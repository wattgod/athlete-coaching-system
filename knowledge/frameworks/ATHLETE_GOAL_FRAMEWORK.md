### Layer 1: Universal Goal Framework

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 GOAL → PLAN → EXECUTE                      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. GOAL (Where you want to go)                             │
│    - SMARRTY: Specific, Measurable, Actionable,            │
│      Relevant, Risky, Time-bound, Y (Why)                  │
│                                                            │
│ 2. PLAN (How you'll get there)                             │
│    - What does the goal require?                           │
│    - Where am I now?                                       │
│    - What's my limiting factor?                            │
│    - What practices/actions address it?                    │
│    - How do I progress?                                    │
│                                                            │
│ 3. EXECUTE (Actually doing it)                             │
│    - Execute with feedback                                 │
│    - Automate to habits                                    │

### Layer 2: Training Process Model

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ FIGURE OUT  │────▶│ MANIPULATE  │────▶│   MANAGE    │────▶│  OUTCOME    │

│             │     │             │     │  Feeling    │     │             │

```

**Critical Insight:**
```
Event Demands (GOAL) → determines WHAT you train for (specificity)
Rider Ability + Availability → determines HOW you manipulate (system selection)
```

The MANIPULATE stage is driven by Rider Ability, NOT by Goal. Two athletes with the same goal get different volume/intensity prescriptions based on their ability level and available hours.

### Layer 3: Habit Formation (Four Laws)

| Law | Build Good Habit | Break Bad Habit |
|-----|------------------|-----------------|
| 1st | Make it OBVIOUS | Make it INVISIBLE |
| 2nd | Make it ATTRACTIVE | Make it UNATTRACTIVE |
| 3rd | Make it EASY | Make it DIFFICULT |
| 4th | Make it SATISFYING | Make it UNSATISFYING |

## Part 2: Key Principles (James Clear Insights)

### On Systems vs Goals

> "Goals are best for people who care about winning once. Systems are best for people who care about winning repeatedly."

**Implication for Athletes**: Don't focus on "I want to finish an Ironman." Focus on "What daily habits make me the type of person who completes Ironmans?"

### On Identity

> "Every action you take is like a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

**Application**: Frame questionnaire around "Who do you want to become?" not just "What do you want to achieve?"

### On Lifestyle Alignment

> "To want the outcome without the lifestyle is to torture yourself."

**Application**: Must assess whether athlete's available hours, energy windows, and constraints actually match the goal's requirements.

### On Consistency

> "Consistency enlarges ability."
> "The bad days are more important than the good days."
> "Reduce the scope but stick to the schedule."

**Application**: Design minimum viable training that survives worst-case days. Zero days break momentum.

### On Starting

> "So much of it is about mastering the art of getting started."
> "The heaviest weight at the gym is the front door."

**Application**: Environmental design and habit stacking to make starting friction-free.

### On Progress

> "One of the most motivating feelings to the human mind is a feeling of progress."
> "All the greatest returns are delayed."

**Application**: Build in visible progress markers. Help athletes understand the compound curve.

### On Fun

> "What would it look like if this was fun?"
> "The person who's having fun is actually the person who's dangerous."
> "Grit is fit."

**Application**: Match athletes to training styles they'll actually enjoy.

## Part 3: System Matching Logic

### Critical Insight: What Drives What

```
GOAL (Event Demands) → WHAT you train for (specificity, energy systems)
ABILITY + AVAILABILITY → HOW you train (volume/intensity manipulation)
```

**The Manipulate variable is NOT driven by goal—it's driven by:**
1. **Rider Ability** (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
2. **Training Availability** (hours/week + session length constraints)

### Primary Selection: Ability × Availability Matrix

```
              <6h/wk       6-10h/wk     10-15h/wk    >15h/wk
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BEGINNER   │ Sweet Spot  │ Traditional │ Traditional │   HVLI/      │
│ (0-2 yrs)  │ (simple)    │ (scaled)    │ (full)      │ Traditional  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│INTERMEDIATE│ Sweet Spot  │ Polarized   │ Polarized   │ Polarized    │
│ (2-5 yrs)  │ HIIT-focused│ Sweet Spot  │ Traditional │ Traditional  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ADVANCED   │ HIIT+Blocks │ Block       │ Block       │ Block        │
│ (5+ yrs)   │Critical Pwr │ Polarized   │ Norwegian   │ HVLI+Block   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Same Goal, Different Athletes = Different HOW

| Goal | Beginner + 6h/wk | Advanced + 15h/wk |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 100mi Gravel | Simple Sweet Spot, 2 quality/wk | Block periodization, complex loads |
| Sub-5hr Century | Basic threshold focus | Volume base + targeted blocks |

### Secondary Layer: Event Type → Specificity

| Event | Emphasis WITHIN System |
|-------|------------------------|
| Short/Power | VO₂/anaerobic work |
| Threshold/TT | Sustained threshold intervals |
| Long Endurance | Durability, fat oxidation |
| Mixed/Variable | Balanced + surge capacity |

## Part 4: Questionnaire Architecture

### Section Flow

1. **Identity & Vision** → Who do you want to become?
2. **Goal Specification** → SMARRTY framework
3. **Current Reality** → Fitness, history, limiters
4. **Constraints** → Time, control, environment
5. **Sustainability** → Bad-day floor, fun factor
6. **Support** → Social, monitoring
7. **Event Analysis** → Demands mapping

### Key Translation Points

**Habit Stacking Formula:**
```
"After I [EXISTING HABIT], I will [NEW TRAINING BEHAVIOR]."
```

**Minimum Viable Training Question:**
> "What can I stick to even on the bad days?"

**Fun Factor Assessment:**
> "What would this look like if it was fun?"

---

## Part 5: Implementation Principles

### The 1% Rule

> "On any given day, 1% better or 1% worse is very minor. But two or five or ten years later, that's a meaningful difference."

### Two Time Frames That Matter

- **10 years** = the meaningful outcome you're working toward
- **1 hour** = what you can do today to serve that

### Seasons Change, Habits Adapt

> "Habits have to change shape over time. Things have a season."

Systems must include:
- Periodic review triggers
- Permission to adapt
- Block/phase transitions

### The Secret to Winning

> "The secret to winning is learning how to lose."

Plan for:
- Recovery from missed days
- Quick rebound protocols
- Mental reset strategies

## Part 6: Practical Tools

### Progress Metrics by System

| System | Primary Metric |
|--------|----------------|
| Traditional | CTL + HR/power decoupling |
| Polarized | Zone 1 time % + interval power |
| Sweet Spot | TSS/hr + FTP trend |
| HIIT | MAP/VO₂max + W' |
| Block | Block-specific KPIs |
| Autoregulated | HRV trend + RPE |

### Environment Priming Checklist

- [ ] Training cues visible (kit laid out, bike accessible)
- [ ] Friction reduced (bag packed, route planned)
- [ ] Rewards in place (tracking visible, social accountability)
- [ ] Worst-case protocol defined

### Recovery Protocol

When athlete misses training:
1. Don't break streak mentally
2. Scale down next session (don't compensate)
3. Return to system within 24-48 hours
4. Review: Was this a signal or noise?

## Appendix: Key Quote Bank

### For Motivation
- "The heaviest weight at the gym is the front door."
- "Everybody works out on the good days. But can you show up on the bad ones?"

### For Perspective
- "Goals are for winning once. Systems are for winning repeatedly."
- "Your current habits are perfectly designed to deliver your current results."

### For Sustainability
- "What can I stick to even on the bad days? That becomes your baseline."
- "Reduce the scope but stick to the schedule."

### For Identity
- "Once you adopt a habit as part of your story, you'll fight to maintain it."
- "Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

### For Long-term Thinking
- "Time will magnify whatever you feed it."
- "If you're on a good trajectory, all you need is time."
