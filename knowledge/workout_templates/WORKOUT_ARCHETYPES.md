## Introduction

### Purpose

The workout archetype system serves three primary functions:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures the same workout type has identical structure, cadence, and position prescriptions across all plans
2. **Scalability**: Enables automated generation of thousands of training plans with consistent quality
3. **Scientific Rigor**: Each archetype targets specific physiological adaptations with evidence-based prescriptions

### Core Principles

- **Archetype Detection**: Workouts are classified by name patterns, not manual tagging
- **Dimensional Prescriptions**: Each archetype has specific cadence and position requirements
- **Progressive Complexity**: Workouts evolve through 6 levels, from introduction to peak volume
- **Race-Specific Adaptation**: Archetypes can be modified for race-specific demands (heat, terrain, duration)

---

## Archetype Classification System

### Detection Method

Archetypes are detected automatically from workout names using pattern matching. This ensures consistency without manual intervention.

**Detection Priority:**
1. Pattern matching against known archetype patterns
2. Keyword fallback (e.g., "EASY" → endurance, "HARD" → threshold)
3. Default to "general" archetype

### Archetype Categories

The system recognizes 19 distinct archetypes organized into 8 categories:

#### 1. VO2max Development (4 archetypes)
- `vo2_steady`: Traditional VO2max intervals
- `vo2_30_30`: Broken VO2 accumulation (30s on/30s off)
- `vo2_40_20`: Repeated high-intensity efforts (40s on/20s off)
- `vo2_extended`: Extended VO2max intervals

#### 2. Threshold Development (3 archetypes)
- `threshold_steady`: Sustained threshold intervals
- `threshold_progressive`: Progressive threshold work
- `threshold_touch`: Brief threshold maintenance

#### 3. Mixed/Climbing (2 archetypes)
- `mixed_climbing`: Tempo base with threshold surges
- `mixed_intervals`: VO2 to threshold transitions

#### 4. Force Development (1 archetype)
- `sfr`: Sustained Force Repetitions (low cadence, high torque)

#### 5. Tempo/Aerobic (2 archetypes)
- `tempo`: Sustained tempo work
- `g_spot`: Sweet spot training (88-94% FTP)

#### 6. Neuromuscular (2 archetypes)
- `stomps`: Max torque from near-stop
- `microbursts`: High-cadence leg speed work (15s on/15s off)

#### 7. Race-Pace Management (1 archetype)
- `normalized_power`: Normalized Power (NP) and Intensity Factor (IF) training

#### 8. Endurance/Recovery (4 archetypes)
- `endurance`: Long aerobic base building
- `race_simulation`: Race-day execution practice
- `testing`: FTP and power profile assessments
- `rest`: Complete recovery days

## Dimensional Prescriptions

### Cadence Prescriptions

Each archetype has specific cadence requirements based on physiological goals:

| Archetype | Cadence Range | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **VO2max** | 90-100 RPM | High turnover maximizes VO2max efficiency |
| **Threshold** | 85-95 RPM | Race cadence for sustainable power |
| **Mixed Climbing** | 70-80 RPM | Simulates climbing demands |
| **SFR** | 50-60 RPM | Force development at low cadence |
| **Tempo/G-Spot** | 85-95 RPM | Sustainable rhythm for aerobic work |
| **Stomps** | 50-60 RPM start, accelerate | Max torque development |
| **Microbursts** | 100-110 RPM | High leg speed for neuromuscular adaptation |
| **Endurance** | Self-selected | Comfortable cadence for fat oxidation |
| **Race Simulation** | Variable | Match race demands |
| **Normalized Power** | Variable | Match terrain and strategy |

### Position Prescriptions

Position requirements optimize biomechanical efficiency and race specificity:

| Archetype | Position | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **VO2max** | Seated, hoods | Stable power platform |
| **Threshold** | Seated, drops or hoods | Race position practice |
| **Mixed Climbing** | Seated, hoods | Climbing efficiency |
| **SFR** | Seated, hoods | Torque focus without position distraction |
| **Tempo** | Alternating hoods/drops | Position practice for long efforts |
| **G-Spot** | Seated, hoods | Sustainable position |
| **Stomps** | Seated to standing | Power development across positions |
| **Microbursts** | Seated, hoods | Quick turnover focus |
| **Endurance** | Alternating | Comfort and position practice |
| **Race Simulation** | Race position | Full race gear practice |

### Special Position Guidance

**Durability Workouts**: Long Z2 rides (≥90 min) followed by intervals
- **Z2 sections**: Position alternation every 30 min (drops ↔ hoods)
- **Intervals**: Position as specified for interval archetype
- **Purpose**: Build fatigue, then perform quality work when tired

## Progression Framework

### Six-Level Progression System

All quality workouts progress through 6 levels, each with specific focus:

#### Level 1: Introduction
- **Focus**: Execution quality over power targets
- **Volume**: Minimal (e.g., 3-4 intervals)
- **Purpose**: Learn the pattern, establish movement quality

#### Level 2: Building Volume
- **Focus**: Same pattern, more work
- **Volume**: Moderate increase (e.g., 5-6 intervals)
- **Purpose**: Accumulation drives fitness gains

#### Level 3: Cadence & Position Focus
- **Focus**: Refine execution dimensions
- **Volume**: Same as Level 2
- **Purpose**: Perfect cadence and position prescriptions

#### Level 4: Consolidation
- **Focus**: Quality over ambition
- **Volume**: Slight reduction or maintenance
- **Purpose**: Let body absorb previous weeks' work

#### Level 5: Extended Sets
- **Focus**: More work per set
- **Volume**: Increased interval duration or sets
- **Purpose**: Real adaptations lock in at this volume

#### Level 6: Peak Volume
- **Focus**: Maximum training load
- **Volume**: Highest volume for archetype
- **Purpose**: Build capacity race day demands

### 16. Normalized Power / Intensity Factor (`normalized_power`)

**Purpose**: Normalized Power (NP) and Intensity Factor (IF) training. Target IF of 0.85 for the duration. How you achieve it is up to you—high average power, hard on uphills, easier on downhills. This teaches race-pace management and power distribution across variable terrain.

**Structure**: 2-3 hours targeting IF of 0.85 through variable power distribution

**Cadence**: Variable (match terrain and strategy)

**Position**: Variable (match terrain demands - hard on uphills, easier on downhills)

**Key Instructions**:
- Put Normalized Power (NP) field on your head unit
- Target IF of 0.85 for the duration
- Strategy is your choice:
  - High average power throughout
  - Hard on uphills, easier on downhills
  - Variable power matching terrain

**Progression**: 
- Level 1: Target IF 0.85 for 2 hours. Introduction to NP/IF training. Focus on understanding how variable power affects NP.
- Level 2: Target IF 0.85 for 2.5 hours. Building duration. Experiment with different strategies (high average vs. variable).
- Level 3: Target IF 0.85 for 2.5 hours. Refining strategy. Focus on optimizing power distribution across terrain.
- Level 4: Target IF 0.85 for 2 hours. Consolidation. Let the body absorb the previous weeks' work.
- Level 5: Target IF 0.85 for 3 hours. Extended duration. This is where real race-pace management skills develop.

**When Used**: Build and peak phases. Essential for learning race-pace management and power distribution across variable terrain. Teaches athletes to maintain consistent physiological load (IF) through variable power output.

**Physiological Rationale**: 
- Normalized Power accounts for the physiological cost of variable power output
- IF of 0.85 represents a sustainable but challenging intensity for long gravel races
- Variable power strategies (hard on climbs, easy on descents) are more efficient than constant power
- Teaches athletes to manage NP/IF rather than just average power

**When Used**: 
- After hard training blocks
- Recovery weeks
- Taper periods

---

## Special Workout Types

### Durability Workouts

**Definition**: Long Z2 ride (1-2 hours) followed by intervals while fatigued, then optionally more Z2.

**Purpose**: Building your ability to perform intervals when already fatigued—this is race simulation. The long Z2 ride first builds fatigue, then the intervals teach your body to sustain power when tired.

**Structure**:
1. **Z2 Endurance Phase**: 60-120 minutes at 65-75% FTP
   - Position alternation every 30 min (drops ↔ hoods)
   - Self-selected cadence
2. **Interval Phase**: Quality intervals (threshold, VO2, or mixed)
   - Position as specified for interval archetype
   - Cadence per interval archetype
3. **Final Z2 Phase** (optional): Additional Z2 to complete ride

**When Used**: 
- Build and peak phases
- Essential for 12-16 hour gravel races
- Teaches body to perform quality work when fatigued

**Progression**:
- Level 1: 60min Z2 → 3x5min threshold
- Level 2: 90min Z2 → 4x5min threshold
- Level 3: 90min Z2 → 4x5min threshold (position focus)
- Level 4: 75min Z2 → 3x5min threshold (consolidation)
- Level 5: 120min Z2 → 5x5min threshold (extended duration)
- Level 6: 120min Z2 → 6x5min threshold (peak volume)

## Best Practices

### 1. Archetype Selection

- **Match to Phase**: Use appropriate archetypes for training phase
- **Progressive Overload**: Follow 6-level progression system
- **Recovery Integration**: Balance quality work with adequate recovery

### 2. Cadence Adherence

- **Strict for Quality Sessions**: VO2max, threshold, SFR require specific cadence
- **Flexible for Endurance**: Self-selected for long rides
- **Position-Dependent**: Some cadence prescriptions depend on position

### 3. Position Practice

- **Race-Specific**: Practice race position (drops) in threshold work
- **Alternation**: Long endurance rides alternate positions
- **Durability**: Position alternation on Z2, specific position on intervals

### 4. Progression Management

- **Don't Skip Levels**: Each level serves a purpose
- **Consolidation Weeks**: Level 4 is critical for adaptation
- **Peak Volume**: Level 6 should be used sparingly (peak phase only)

### 5. Testing Integration

- **Baseline**: Week 1 testing establishes zones
- **Progress Checks**: Every 6 weeks assess fitness
- **Final Check**: Week before race confirms readiness

### 6. Durability Workouts

- **Build Phase**: Introduce durability workouts in build phase
- **Progression**: Start with shorter Z2 rides, build to 2+ hours
- **Interval Selection**: Use threshold or VO2max intervals after Z2
