# Nate Wilson Algorithmic Coaching Skill v3.0

Complete Coaching Philosophy Extraction from 10 Years of Data (2014-2024)

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Algorithmize Nate Wilson's coaching methodology for ZWO generation
**Data Source:** 2,577 workouts across 10 years, multiple athletes

---

## Executive Summary

This skill captures the complete algorithmic framework extracted from Nate Wilson's coaching library. The v3 update adds critical insights about **multi-dimensional prescription** - the elements beyond zone distribution that create superior training stimulus.

**Key Insight:** Zone distribution is table stakes. Any decent plan gets that roughly right. The Nate Wilson difference is **how** power is made within those zones.

**Core Philosophy Alignment with Gravel God:**
- "Confidence > Consistency" ≈ "Discipline = Restraint"
- Recovery emphasis = "Recovery makes you fast"
- Multi-dimensional prescription = Superior race preparation
- Race-contextual training = Durability when it matters

---

## THE FOUR PILLARS OF NATE WILSON COACHING

### Pillar 1: Patience (Prescribing Within Ability)

**The Problem:** Coaches constantly "look for answers" - testing, probing, pushing to find limits.

**Nate's Approach:** Trust the process. Prescribe what the athlete can execute *well*.

**Implementation:**
- Prescribe power as RANGES, not absolutes: "300-330w" not "315w"
- "Start on the lower end of the range"
- "Build if feeling good" (optional, not mandatory)
- FTP tests are rare - race results inform training, not lab tests
- If an athlete fails a workout, the prescription was wrong

**Language Patterns:**
```
"Start on the lower end of the range"
"If you're feeling like a hero, gradually ratchet it up"
"Don't smash the pedals in the warm up"
"Space as you like"
```

---

### Pillar 2: Changing Pace (Position × Cadence × Transitions)

**The Problem:** Coaches prescribe one-dimensionally: "3x10 at threshold"

**Nate's Approach:** Every interval has multiple dimensions that must be specified.

**The Multi-Dimensional Prescription Matrix:**

| Dimension | Options | Training Effect |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Power** | Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6 | Energy system |
| **Cadence** | Low (50-65), Med (80-90), High (100+) | Fiber recruitment |
| **Position** | Seated/hoods, Seated/drops, Standing | Muscle groups, race specificity |
| **Transitions** | Steady, alternating, progressive | Pace change ability |

**The 9 Ways to Make Threshold Power:**

| | Low Cad (50-65) | Med Cad (80-90) | High Cad (100+) |
|---|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Seated/Hoods** | SFR Threshold | "Normal" | High-cad Threshold |
| **Seated/Drops** | TT Force | TT Race | TT Cadence |
| **Standing** | Climbing Force | Attack/Surge | Sprint |

**Same power. Different adaptations. Different race preparation.**

**Data Validation:** ~40% of Nate's workouts include explicit cadence prescription. ~15% include position prescription. ~12% include pace-change transitions within intervals.

**Key Insight (from Colby Pearce):** Cyclists need to be able to change pace. You develop these "gears" through constant work across all dimensions, not occasional focus.

---

### Pillar 3: Durability (Quality Work After Kilojoules)

**The Problem:** Athletes do intervals fresh, then wonder why they fade in races.

**Nate's Approach:** Do specific work AFTER burning kilojoules.

**The Durability Equation:**
```
Race Performance = (Power Capability) × (Durability Factor)
Where Durability Factor = ability to maintain power after 2000+ kJ
```

**Fatigue State Matrix:**

| Workout Timing | kJ Burned | Training Effect |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Fresh (after warmup) | 0-500 | Peak power, neuromuscular |
| Mid-ride | 1000-2000 | Sustained power, mental focus |
| Late-ride | 2500+ | **Durability**, race simulation |

**Signature Durability Patterns:**
1. **Tired 20:** 3-4 hours Z2 endurance (burn 2500+ kJ) → 1x20min threshold
2. **Loaded Progressions:** 90 min Z2 → 3x15min progressing Z3→Z4→Z5
3. **Bookended:** Same interval set at START and END of long ride
4. **Tempo Finish:** Long Z2 → Last 30-45min at G-Spot
5. **Surges Late:** 4-5hr endurance → Last 90min includes 8-10x30s surges

**Data Validation:** ~10% of Nate's workouts explicitly include late-ride intensity structure. Present year-round.

---

### Pillar 4: Fueling (Thriving, Not Surviving)

**The Problem:** Athletes under-fuel, then struggle through workouts and accumulate fatigue.

**Nate's Approach:** Fuel the work so athletes thrive.

**The Fueling Philosophy:**
- 60-80g CHO per hour during all quality sessions
- "Don't throw the adaptation away by under-eating"
- Practice race nutrition in every long workout
- Recovery nutrition is part of the prescription

**Why Fueling Matters for Adaptation:**

Under-fueled training creates:
- Elevated cortisol (stress hormone)
- Psychological dread of training
- Incomplete recovery between sessions

Well-fueled training creates:
- Lower perceived effort at same power
- Positive association with hard work
- Complete adaptation before next session

**Data Validation:** 15-25% of Nate's workouts include explicit fueling prescriptions. Higher percentage in earlier years (may indicate athletes internalized the habit).

**Language Patterns:**
```
"70-80g CHO per hour, minimum"
"Don't throw the adaptation away by under-eating"
"Train nutrition: trial high-carb drink mixes"
"If you bonk, the workout is worthless"
```

## ZONE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS (Corrected)

### The Error in Simple Category Counting

Counting workout categories as intensity buckets is **wrong**. A "Sprint workout" isn't 100% sprinting - it's 90% Z1-Z2 with brief Z6-Z7 spikes.

### Time-in-Zone Estimates by Workout Category

| Category | Total Time | Z1-Z2 % | Z3 % | Z4 % | Z5+ % |
|----------|------------|---------|------|------|-------|
| Sprint/NM | 60-90min | 88-92% | 0% | 0% | 8-12% |
| Cadence Work | 75min | 87-93% | 7-13% | 0% | 0% |
| SFR | 75min | 68% | 0% | 32% | 0% |
| VO2max | 70min | 77% | 0% | 0% | 23% |
| Threshold | 90min | 60% | 0% | 40% | 0% |
| Tempo/G-Spot | 90min | 56% | 44% | 0% | 0% |
| Endurance | 180min+ | 100% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Recovery | 45-60min | 100% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

### Weighted Time-in-Zone (Typical Week)

Assuming 12-hour training week with Nate's workout mix:

| Zone | Hours | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Z1-Z2** | ~10h | **~84%** |
| **Z3 (G-Spot)** | ~0.7h | **~6%** |
| **Z4 (Threshold)** | ~0.8h | **~7%** |
| **Z5+ (VO2/Sprint)** | ~0.35h | **~3%** |

### Nate vs. Established Methodologies

| Methodology | Z1-Z2 | Z3 | Z4+ |
|-------------|-------|-----|-----|
| Polarized (Seiler) | 80% | **0-5%** | 15-20% |
| Pyramidal | 75-80% | 15-20% | 5% |
| Threshold/SS | 50-60% | 30-40% | 5-10% |
| **Nate Wilson** | **84%** | **6%** | **10%** |

### Key Finding: Nate IS Polarized (With G-Spot Tolerance)

- **84% Z1-Z2** - Matches polarized prescription
- **6% Z3** - Higher than strict Seiler (0-5%), but deliberate
- **10% Z4+** - Within polarized range

**The G-Spot tolerance is the main deviation.** Seiler says "never tempo." Nate uses 6% tempo/G-Spot for:
- Race pace calibration
- Mental training (sustained focus)
- Time efficiency when needed

## PERIODIZATION OF DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS

### The Key Discovery: Dimensions Are Periodized

Dimensional elements (SFR, cadence, durability) are NOT constant throughout the year. They're **frontloaded in base phase**.

### Monthly Distribution Data

| Element | Dec-Feb (BASE) | Mar-Apr (BUILD) | May-Aug (RACE) | Sep-Nov (TRANS) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| SFR/Force | **High (33-45)** | Moderate (16-21) | Low (13-18) | Rebuilding (17-19) |
| High Cadence | **High (37-76)** | Moderate (39-45) | Low (16-25) | Rebuilding (14-35) |
| Durability | **High (29-41)** | Low (15) | Moderate (18-22) | Low (9-10) |
| Threshold | Building (12-30) | **Peak (40)** | Maintains (30-34) | Very Low (5-13) |
| VO2max | Low-Mod (9-21) | **High (17-28)** | Variable (11-26) | Very Low (2-6) |
| Recovery | Moderate | **High (32-41)** | **Peak (35-46)** | Low (8-11) |

### The Periodization Model

```
PHASE       DIMENSIONAL WORK         INTENSITY WORK      RECOVERY NEED
            (SFR/Cadence/Durability) (Threshold/VO2)

TRANSITION  ▂▃▃                      ▁▁                  ▁▁
BASE        ▇▇▆                      ▃▄                  ▄▄
BUILD       ▄▃                       ▇▇                  ▆▆
RACE        ▂▂                       ▅▅                  ▇▇
```

### Phase-Specific Dimensional Prescription

**BASE PHASE (Dec-Feb):**
```yaml
sfr_frequency: 2x/week
cadence_work: 2x/week
durability_sessions: 1-2x/week
intensity: Low-Moderate (tempo building)
focus: "Building the gears"
```

**BUILD PHASE (Mar-Apr):**
```yaml
sfr_frequency: 1x/week (maintenance)
cadence_work: 1x/week (maintenance)
durability_sessions: 0-1x/week (want freshness for intensity)
intensity: High (threshold/VO2 peak)
focus: "Race-pace development"
```

**RACE PHASE (May-Aug):**
```yaml
sfr_frequency: 0-1x/week (touch-ups)
cadence_work: 0-1x/week (touch-ups)
durability_sessions: 0x/week (races provide this)
intensity: Moderate-High (sharpening, maintenance)
focus: "Using the gears, recovery between races"
```

**TAPER (Race Week):**
```yaml
sfr_frequency: 0
cadence_work: 1x (openers with cadence play)
durability_sessions: 0
intensity: Low with openers
focus: "Fresh legs, race ready"
```

### Key Insight: SFR and High Cadence Peak TOGETHER

| Month | SFR | High Cadence | Ratio |
|-------|-----|--------------|-------|
| Dec | 45 | 76 | 1:1.7 |
| Jan | 34 | 37 | 1:1.1 |
| Feb | 33 | 47 | 1:1.4 |

Both ends of the cadence spectrum develop simultaneously in base phase. This aligns with Colby Pearce's philosophy: you need BOTH force AND speed to develop a complete pedal stroke.

## WORKOUT METADATA FRAMEWORK

### The Complete Prescription Template

Each workout should include these dimensions:

```python
workout_metadata = {
    # STANDARD (Zone Distribution)
    'zone': 'Z4',
    'duration': '3x12min',
    'rest': '5min',
    'recovery_ratio': 1.0,  # 1:1 for threshold

    # DIMENSIONAL (The Nate Add)
    'cadence': 'low',        # low/med/high/variable
    'cadence_target': 65,    # 60-70 rpm for TT threshold
    'position': 'drops',     # hoods/drops/standing/variable
    'transitions': False,    # True if includes sit/stand changes

    # TIMING (Durability)
    'timing': 'late_ride',   # fresh/mid/late
    'prereq_kj': 1500,       # kJ to burn before starting
    'prereq_duration': 90,   # minutes of Z2 before starting

    # FUELING
    'fueling': '70g/hr',     # CHO target
    'hydration': 'race_protocol',  # practice race fueling

    # PROGRESSION
    'progression': 'ratchet',  # steady/ratchet/build
    'start_power': 0.97,       # Start at lower end
    'end_power': 1.02,         # Build to upper end
}
```

### Comparison: Generic vs. Nate Prescription

**Generic Plan:**
```
Week 6, Tuesday: 4x8 VO2max @ 115%
Week 6, Saturday: 4hr Endurance
```

**Nate Plan:**
```
Week 6, Tuesday: 4x8 VO2max @ 115-122%
  - Reps 1,3: seated, 90rpm
  - Reps 2,4: standing start, build 60→100rpm
  - Progressive: 115% → 117% → 119% → 122%
  - 70g CHO/hr

Week 6, Saturday: 4hr Endurance
  - Z2 base with 12x15s torque accels (every 20min)
  - Last 45min: 1x15 G-Spot
  - Practice race fueling protocol (80g CHO/hr)
```

**Same zones. Same TSS. Superior stimulus.**

## ALGORITHMIC PRINCIPLES

### Recovery Duration Rules

| Workout Type | Recovery Duration | Work:Rest Ratio |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| VO2max | 4 min | 1:1 |
| Threshold | 4-5 min | 1:1 |
| Tempo/G-Spot | 5-6 min | 4:1 ("should feel short") |
| SFR | 2-4 min | 1.5:1 |
| Sprint (within set) | 20-30 sec | Minimal |
| Sprint (between sets) | 5 min | Full |

### Power Zone Prescription

| Zone | Name | % FTP | ZWO Power |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| Z1 | Recovery | <55% | 0.45-0.55 |
| Z2 | Endurance | 63-77% | 0.63-0.77 |
| Z3 Low | Low Tempo | 74-86% | 0.74-0.86 |
| **G-Spot** | **Race Pace** | **86-94%** | **0.86-0.94** |
| Z4 | Threshold | 100-109% | 1.00-1.09 |
| Z5 | VO2max | 114-129% | 1.14-1.29 |
| Z6 | Sprint | 143%+ | 1.40+ |

### Cadence by Workout Type

| Workout Type | Target Cadence | Purpose |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| SFR/Force | 50-60 rpm | Muscle fiber recruitment |
| TT Threshold | 60-70 rpm | Position-specific power |
| Normal | 85-95 rpm | Self-selected efficiency |
| Tempo/G-Spot | 90-100 rpm | Aerobic efficiency |
| High-Cad Accels | 110+ rpm | Neuromuscular speed |
| Sprint Peak | 120+ rpm | Maximum power output |

### Intra-Set Progression ("Ratchet It Up")

1. **Start Conservative:** "Start on the lower end of the range"
2. **Build Each Rep:** "Ratchet it up a bit with each effort"
3. **Finish Empty:** "Last one should be bleeding from the eyeballs"

```python
def generate_vo2_progression(num_reps=4, base_power=1.15, increment=0.02):
    intervals = []
    for i in range(num_reps):
        power = base_power + (i * increment)
        intervals.append({'rep': i+1, 'power': round(power, 2)})
    return intervals

# Result: 1.15 → 1.17 → 1.19 → 1.21
```

## ARCHETYPE PROGRESSION RULES

### Rule 1: Volume Before Intensity

1. First: Add reps at same duration
2. Then: Extend duration at same reps
3. Finally: Increase intensity targets

### Rule 2: The 10% Rule

- Total interval time: +10% max per week
- Power targets: +2-3% when duration stable
- Never both simultaneously

### Rule 3: Periodization by Phase

| Phase | Primary Archetypes | Secondary |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Base | SFR, Cadence, Tempo, Surges | Endurance |
| Build | Threshold, VO2, O/U | SFR (maintenance) |
| Peak | 30/30s, Tired Tempo | Touch-ups |
| Race | Openers, Short sprints | Minimal |

### Rule 4: Recovery Follows Intensity

- After VO2 or threshold: Z1/Z2 next day
- Include one-leg drills
- "Flush the adrenaline"

### Rule 5: Never Back-to-Back Key Sessions

- Key = VO2, Threshold, or SFR
- Always separate by easy day
- Exception: Racing

### The Complete Nate Voice Formula

**Restraint + Permission + Vivid Imagery + Race Application**

A single workout description combines multiple elements:

> "1.5h z2 flats warmup, keep power decent but not smashing here, 200-240 is plenty. Make it hard, but don't totally nut yourself, because we want one more thresh effort on this ride. When you get to the switchback can start to nut yourself a bit more and finish drooling. Think about light gears all day, saving the big dog until the last minute when you really need it."

**What Makes It Nate:**
1. Ranges not absolutes ("200-240 is plenty")
2. Restraint before effort ("don't totally nut yourself")
3. Permission to go hard ("can start to nut yourself a bit more")
4. Vivid effort description ("finish drooling")
5. Race-relevant pacing ("saving the big dog")
6. Light gear philosophy ("light gears all day")

### Phrases to AVOID (Generic Coach-Speak)

| Don't Say | Why Not |
|-----------|---------|
| "Complete 4x4 at 115% FTP" | Too clinical |
| "This workout targets your VO2max system" | Too textbook |
| "Make sure to warm up properly" | Too generic |
| "Great job!" | Hollow praise |
| "You've got this!" | Empty motivation |
| "Push through the pain" | Generic suffering |
| "Leave it all on the road" | Cliche |

**Instead:** Specific ranges with context, vivid physical descriptions, permission AND boundaries, race-relevant application, authentic voice.

## INTEGRATION WITH GRAVEL GOD TRAINING PLANS

### Phase-to-Workout Mapping

| GG Phase | Primary Workouts | Dimensional Focus |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Base (Wk 1-4) | SFR, Z2+Surges, Cadence Accels, Tempo | **Heavy** dimensional work |
| Build (Wk 5-8) | VO2 4x4, O/U, Threshold, G-Spot | **Maintenance** dimensional |
| Peak (Wk 9-11) | VO2 30/30s, G-Spot+Surges, Tired 20 | **Touch-up** dimensional |
| Taper (Wk 12) | Openers, Short sprints, Reduced volume | **Minimal** dimensional |

### Volume Tier Adjustments

| Tier | Weekly Hours | Dimensional Approach |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Ayahuasca (0-5h) | Limited | Can't do late-ride durability; focus on position×cadence |
| Finisher (8-12h) | Moderate | 1 durability session possible; full dimensional work |
| Compete (12-18h) | Substantial | Full Nate methodology; 1-2 durability sessions |
| Podium (18+h) | Maximum | Multiple durability sessions; full dimensional work |

## POWER ZONE REFERENCE (Coggan)

| Zone | Name | % FTP | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Z1 | Active Recovery | <55% | Easy spinning, recovery |
| Z2 | Endurance | 55-75% | Aerobic base, conversation pace |
| Z3 | Tempo | 76-90% | "G-Spot" upper end (86-90%) |
| Z4 | Threshold | 91-105% | Race pace, sustainable hard |
| Z5 | VO2max | 106-120% | Hard, 3-8min max |
| Z6 | Anaerobic | 121-150% | Very hard, 30sec-2min |
| Z7 | Neuromuscular | Max | Sprints, <30sec |

**CRITICAL: Always prescribe zones, not raw watts.** Zones scale to any athlete's FTP.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Zone distribution is the foundation.** Nate's approach is essentially polarized (84% easy, 16% hard) with deliberate G-Spot tolerance (6%).

**Dimensional prescription is the quality layer.** Position × Cadence × Timing × Fueling create superior training stimulus that:
- Prepares athletes to change pace (race demand)
- Builds durability (power when fatigued)
- Develops force AND speed simultaneously
- Practices race execution, not just fitness

**The Nate Formula:**
```
Superior Training =
    (Correct Zone Distribution) ×
    (Position × Cadence × Timing × Fueling) ×
    (Periodized Dimensional Emphasis)
```

This transforms zone-based plans into race-ready preparation.
