# The Gear Reality Check

The gravel industry wants you to believe you need a $12,000 bike with electronic shifting, carbon everything, and aerodynamic optimization to ride on dirt roads.

You don't.

You need a bike that fits, tires that don't suck, gearing that lets you climb without walking, and the fitness to pedal it for hours. Everything else is optimization you can worry about after you've finished your first few races.

## What You Actually Need

| Component | Minimum Viable | Why | Skip Until Later |
|-----------|----------------|-----|------------------|
| Frame | Any bike with drop bars, clearance for 38mm+ tires | Gravel demands tire clearance more than aero gains | Carbon frames, "gravel-specific geometry" |
| Tires | 38-45mm, tubeless setup, moderate tread | Wide tires = comfort + traction. Tubeless = fewer flats | Boutique brands, TPU tubes |
| Gearing | Low gear under 1:1 ratio (e.g., 32x34 or easier) | Steep climbs on loose gravel require spinning, not mashing | Wireless drivetrains, 1x for aesthetics |
| Wheels | Anything alloy that holds air and stays true | Durability matters more than 200g weight savings | Carbon wheels (unless you crash a lot and enjoy expensive repairs) |
| Cockpit | Bars that are comfortable for 6+ hours, flared drops help | Gravel riding is long. Comfort beats aero | Fancy carbon bars, built-in computer mounts |
| Saddle | Whatever you've been training on | Don't change saddles before a race | Trendy cutout designs you haven't tested |
| Pedals | Clipless or flats you're comfortable with | Use what you've been riding | Switching from flats to clipless 2 weeks before race day |

## Bottles and Storage

- Two bottle cages minimum (three if bike allows)
- Jersey pockets for food (gels, bars, real food)
- Frame bag or bento box only if racing 100+ miles (otherwise they're just in the way)

## Repair Kit (Mandatory)

- Spare tube (even if tubeless)
- Tire plug kit + CO2 or mini pump
- Multi-tool with chain breaker
- Quick link for your chain
- Tire levers

If you can't fix a flat in under 10 minutes, practice until you can.
