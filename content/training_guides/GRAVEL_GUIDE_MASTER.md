# CHAPTER 1: What Is Gravel Racing? (And What You Actually Need)

Gravel racing is riding bikes on unpaved roads for distances ranging from "aggressive Saturday ride" to "questioning your life choices."

The routes are typically 30-200+ miles of dirt, gravel, sand, crushed limestone, fire roads, and occasionally pavement when the route designer runs out of worse options. The surfaces vary from smooth hardpack (fast) to chunky limestone (slow and punishing) to sandy two-track (pray your tires hold air).

Here's what makes gravel different from road racing or mountain biking:

It's more accessible than road racing. No peloton politics, no sketchy criteriums where one crash takes out 40 people, no unwritten rules about who's allowed to attack when. You show up, you ride, you finish (or don't). The person who wins and the person who finishes last both rode the same course, faced the same challenges, and earned their finish.

It's less technical than mountain biking. You're not navigating rock gardens or launching off drops. Most gravel courses are rideable by anyone with basic bike handling skills and reasonable fitness. The bike does matter, but not as much as road racing where a 30-second gap becomes insurmountable. On gravel, you can have a mechanical, fix it, and still chase back.

It's self-sufficient. Aid stations exist but they're 25-40 miles apart and might run out of what you need. You carry your own food, your own tools, your own flat kit. When something breaks, you fix it. When you bonk, it's because you didn't eat enough. The race doesn't owe you anything.

The spectrum is wide. You can sign up for a 40-mile "fun ride" distance at most events and just enjoy being outside with a bunch of other people who also thought riding on dirt was a good idea. Or you can sign up for the 200-mile suffer fest and find out what you're made of. Both are valid. Both are gravel racing.

The culture rewards suffering, but it doesn't require heroics. Finishing counts. How you finish is between you and your ego.

### The Gear Reality Check

The gravel industry wants you to believe you need a $12,000 bike with electronic shifting, carbon everything, and aerodynamic optimization to ride on dirt roads.

You don't.

You need a bike that fits, tires that don't suck, gearing that lets you climb without walking, and the fitness to pedal it for hours. Everything else is optimization you can worry about after you've finished your first few races.

What you actually need:

| Component | Minimum Viable | Why | Skip Until Later |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Frame | Any bike with drop bars, clearance for 38mm+ tires | Gravel demands tire clearance more than aero gains | Carbon frames, "gravel-specific geometry" |
| Tires | 38-45mm, tubeless setup, moderate tread | Wide tires \= comfort \+ traction. Tubeless \= fewer flats | Boutique brands, TPU tubes |
| Gearing | Low gear under 1:1 ratio (e.g., 32x34 or easier) | Steep climbs on loose gravel require spinning, not mashing | Wireless drivetrains, 1x for aesthetics |
| Wheels | Anything alloy that holds air and stays true | Durability matters more than 200g weight savings | Carbon wheels (unless you crash a lot and enjoy expensive repairs) |
| Cockpit | Bars that are comfortable for 6+ hours, flared drops help | Gravel riding is long. Comfort beats aero | Fancy carbon bars, built-in computer mounts |
| Saddle | Whatever you've been training on | Don't change saddles before a race | Trendy cutout designs you haven't tested |
| Pedals | Clipless or flats you're comfortable with | Use what you've been riding | Switching from flats to clipless 2 weeks before race day |

On bottles and storage:

* Two bottle cages minimum (three if bike allows)  
* Jersey pockets for food (gels, bars, real food)  
* Frame bag or bento box only if racing 100+ miles (otherwise they're just in the way)

On repair kit (mandatory):

* Spare tube (even if tubeless)  
* Tire plug kit \+ CO2 or mini pump  
* Multi-tool with chain breaker  
* Quick link for your chain  
* Tire levers

If you can't fix a flat in under 10 minutes, practice until you can.

---

### The Hierarchy of Speed

Here's what matters, in order:

1\. Fitness \- Costs nothing. Requires time and discipline. Determines 70% of your result.

2\. Pacing and Execution \- Free. Determines 20% of your result. You can be fit and blow up by going out too hard.

3\. Nutrition \- Cheap. Determines 8% of your result. Bonking loses races.

4\. Bike Handling \- Free (just requires practice). Determines 1.5% of your result.

5\. Equipment \- Expensive. Determines 0.5% of your result (unless your equipment is broken or wildly inappropriate).

You can buy your way from 95% to 95.5%. You can't buy your way from 70% to 95%.

The corollary: if you're not already fast on a mediocre bike, a better bike won't make you fast. It'll make you a slower rider on a nicer bike.

Get fit first. Get good at suffering. Get comfortable riding on unpredictable surfaces for hours. Then worry about whether your crankset saves 40 grams.

---

### What You're Actually Signing Up For

Gravel racing demands:

An aerobic engine. These races are long. Even the short ones. You'll be riding for 2-12 hours depending on distance and your fitness. This isn't about peak power. It's about sustainable output for extended duration.

Basic bike handling. You need to corner on loose surfaces, descend without death-gripping your bars, and climb seated on inconsistent traction. None of this is technical by mountain bike standards, but it's not Tour de France smooth roads either.

Self-sufficiency. Aid stations exist, but they're far apart and they run out of things. You carry your own food, fix your own mechanicals, manage your own pacing. The race gives you a route. Everything else is your responsibility.

Mental resilience. Not toughness. Resilience. Everyone wants to quit at some point. The difference between finishing and DNF-ing is often just continuing to pedal when your brain is screaming at you to stop. You don't need to be fearless. You just need to be stubborn.

---

### The Bottom Line

Gravel racing is accessible. You don't need to be a pro cyclist. You don't need a perfect bike. You don't need special genetics.

You need:

* A bike that fits and doesn't break  
* The fitness to ride it for hours  
* The discipline to train consistently  
* The sense to fuel properly and pace conservatively

Everything else is optimization.

If you have those four things, you can finish a gravel race. Whether you finish in 6 hours or 12 hours is between you and your training plan.

That's what the rest of this guide is for.

# CHAPTER 2: Race Selection (The Gravel God Ranking System)

Not all gravel races are created equal. Some are iconic suffer-fests with 10,000 feet of climbing and national-level competition. Others are well-organized local events with pancake-flat routes and a beer garden at the finish.

Both are valid. But they require different preparation.

The problem: most race websites oversell their difficulty and prestige. Every event claims to be "epic" and "world-class." You need an objective framework to evaluate what you're actually signing up for.

The Gravel God Race Ranking System scores races on two dimensions:

1. Course Factors (0-70 points) \- Physical difficulty and demands  
2. Editorial Factors (0-30 points) \- Race quality, prestige, and experience

Total score determines tier classification.

---

### Course Factors (0-70 points possible)

Physical demands that affect training requirements and race difficulty.

| Factor | Max Points | What It Measures |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Distance | 15 | Longer \= harder. 200 miles ≠ 50 miles × 4\. Fatigue accumulates exponentially. |
| Elevation Gain | 15 | Climbing is the great equalizer. 15,000 ft of climbing matters regardless of distance. |
| Terrain Difficulty | 10 | Smooth hardpack (easy) vs. chunky limestone (hard) vs. sand/mud (survival mode). |
| Weather Exposure | 10 | Kansas August heat, Iceland wind, Arizona desert sun \- environmental stress compounds physical stress. |
| Altitude | 10 | Racing above 7,000 ft adds significant physiological challenge. Leadville at 10,000+ ft is a different game. |
| Technical Demand | 5 | Steep loose descents, sustained technical sections, mandatory bike handling skills. |
| Logistical Difficulty | 5 | Remote locations, limited aid, self-supported sections, navigation requirements. |

Total Course Points: 0-70

---

### Editorial Factors (0-30 points possible)

Race quality, prestige, and experience factors that don't directly affect physical training but matter for race selection.

| Factor | Max Points | What It Measures |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Prestige | 10 | Does winning/finishing this race mean something? Unbound, DK, Belgian Waffle Ride \= high prestige. Random county gravel grinder \= low. |
| Community | 5 | Is the gravel community present? Do people travel for this? Is there camaraderie or just registration numbers? |
| Production Quality | 5 | Is the event well-organized? Clear marking, adequate aid, good communication, professional execution. |
| Vibe/Atmosphere | 5 | Is this a party with a bike race attached (Mid South) or a serious competition (Unbound)? Both are fine, know what you're getting. |
| Inclusivity | 3 | Multiple distance options, beginner-friendly, welcoming culture vs. gatekeeping "hardcore" posturing. |
| Value | 2 | Registration cost vs. what you get. $200 for a well-supported event \= reasonable. $200 for marked routes and nothing else \= questionable. |

Total Editorial Points: 0-30

---

### The Tier System

Combined Course \+ Editorial score determines tier.

Tier 1: 80-100 points (Iconic Races)

The marquee events. High difficulty, high prestige, national/international competition. These races define the gravel calendar. The ones people plan their season around. The ones with waitlists and lottery systems.

Examples: Unbound 200, Leadville 100, Belgian Waffle Ride, Mid South, SBT GRVL, Crusher in the Tushar

Tier 2: 65-79 points (Regional Standouts)

Serious races with strong regional followings. Well-organized, challenging courses, meaningful competition at the front. Not quite iconic but respected. You'll see some fast people, solid production value, and courses that demand proper preparation.

Examples: Gravel Worlds, Rebecca's Private Idaho, Barry-Roubaix, Grinduro, Land Run 100

Tier 3: 50-64 points (Solid Local Events)

Good races that are well-executed and locally popular but don't draw national fields. Still challenging, still worth training for, just without the prestige or hype. These are the backbone of the gravel calendar \- consistent, reliable, fun.

Examples: Most state-level gravel races, smaller stage races, regional classics

Tier 4: Under 50 points (Participation Events)

Beginner-friendly, less physically demanding, or primarily social events. Nothing wrong with these \- they're entry points and fun adventures. Great for first-timers, social riders, or anyone who just wants to be outside on bikes without the pressure.

Examples: Local gravel grinders, charity rides, gravel "festivals" with short distances

---

### How to Use This System

Step 1: Find your race's tier

Check the Gravel God race database or score it yourself using the criteria above.

Step 2: Match tier to your goals

* First-time gravel racer? Start with Tier 3-4 events.  
* Experienced and want a challenge? Tier 1-2.  
* Just want to ride bikes with people? Tier 4 is perfect.

Step 3: Select your training plan

Once you know your race tier and have a goal in mind, the next chapter covers how to choose the right training plan based on your available time and current ability level.

The reality check: You can show up to any race with general fitness and finish. But if you're targeting a Tier 1 event and want to perform well (not just survive), you need specific preparation that matches the race demands.

That's what the training plans are for.

---

Got it. Let me rewrite Chapter 3 with that clearer two-variable matrix structure:

---

# CHAPTER 3 — How to Choose Your Training Plan

Choosing the right training plan comes down to two variables:

1. What is your rider ability? (training experience \+ current fitness)  
2. How much time do you have per week? (volume category)

That's it. These two variables create a matrix. Your plan lives at the intersection.

Most people get this wrong because they conflate "how much time I have" with "how fit I am" or they pick based on ego instead of reality. A former Cat 2 road racer who's been off the bike for three years and can only train 5 hours per week is not the same athlete as a complete beginner who's never done endurance sports and has 5 hours per week.

Same weekly hours. Completely different plans.

This chapter walks you through both variables, then shows you how to find your plan at the intersection.

---

## Variable 1: What Is Your Rider Ability?

Rider ability is a combination of training experience and current fitness.

Not one or the other—both.

A former pro who's been off the bike for five years and gained 40 pounds is not an advanced rider. They're intermediate at best. Their experience helps, but their current fitness is the constraint.

A recreational cyclist who's been riding consistently for three years, trains systematically, and shows up fit is not a beginner just because they've never raced. They're intermediate.

Here's how to assess yourself honestly:

### Beginner

You're a beginner if:

* You've never trained systematically for endurance sports (cycling, running, triathlon, etc.)  
* You're currently out of shape or returning after significant time off (2+ years)  
* You don't know your FTP, you've never done structured intervals, and "Zone 2" sounds like a parking designation  
* Long rides for you are 1-2 hours, and you're not sure you could ride 3 hours comfortably right now

This is not an insult. Everyone starts here. The mistake is pretending you're not here when you are.

Beginner plans build base fitness first. They assume you need to develop aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and durability before you can handle intensity. They're conservative by design because your body hasn't adapted to training stress yet.

### Intermediate

You're intermediate if:

* You've got endurance sports background—cycling, running, triathlon, or other aerobic training  
* You're currently fit enough to ride 3-4 hours without falling apart  
* You understand pacing, you've practiced fueling on long rides, and you know what "sustainable discomfort" feels like  
* You've done structured training before or you're a strong recreational cyclist with years of consistent riding

Intermediate plans assume you can handle two quality sessions per week plus endurance volume. They use polarized training (80% easy, 20% hard) because your body can absorb that stress without breaking.

You're not a beginner anymore, but you're not ready for advanced periodization models that stack intensity aggressively.

### Advanced

You're advanced if:

* You're already fast. You've raced seriously (road, gravel, MTB, triathlon—doesn't matter)  
* You know your FTP, you understand interval structure, and you've trained with power or heart rate zones for years  
* You can distinguish between productive suffering and destructive fatigue  
* Your current fitness supports 4-6 hour rides, and you've logged enough hours recently (last 6-12 months) to handle high training loads

Advanced plans use block periodization or the GOAT Method—concentrated periods of specific intensity (threshold blocks, VO2 blocks) followed by recovery. They assume you know your body well enough to execute hard sessions without burying yourself.

If you're guessing whether you're advanced, you're not. Advanced riders know.

---

## Variable 2: How Much Time Do You Have Per Week?

This is simpler. Count the hours you'll actually spend riding each week.

Be honest. Don't count the time you *wish* you had or the time you *might* have if everything goes perfectly. Count the time you'll realistically ride, week after week, for 12 weeks straight.

Life will interfere. Work, family, weather, sickness, travel—something will try to steal your training time. Plan for 80% completion and you'll hit closer to 100%.

Here are the four volume categories:

| Category | Weekly Hours | 12-Week Total | What This Builds |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Ayahuasca | 0-5 hours | 37-75 hours | Minimal viable fitness. Survival mode. |
| Finisher | 8-12 hours | 120-180 hours | Solid aerobic base. Finish strong. |
| Compete | 12-18 hours | 180-270 hours | Race fitness. Top-third performance. |
| Podium | 18-25+ hours | 270-375+ hours | Professional volume. Elite preparation. |

### Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're time-crunched. Maybe you've got a demanding job, young kids, or life circumstances that limit your training time to a few hours per week.

Ayahuasca plans use high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to maximize fitness from minimal time. Two to three hard sessions per week, short endurance rides, and minimal long rides (capped at 2-3 hours).

Critical caveat: These plans assume you already have fitness and experience. If you're a true beginner (no endurance background, currently out of shape), you should not be on an Ayahuasca plan regardless of hours available. HIIT doesn't build base fitness—it sharpens existing fitness. If you don't have a base, HIIT will just break you.

If you're a beginner with only 5 hours per week, your honest options are:

1. Find more training time (move to Finisher category)  
2. Pick an easier/shorter race that matches your preparation level  
3. Accept that you're showing up underprepared and adjust expectations accordingly

Ayahuasca is for experienced cyclists who are time-constrained, not beginners who lack hours.

### Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This is the sweet spot for most gravel racers. You've got enough time to build a real aerobic base, practice race-specific intensity, and complete long rides that prepare you for race distance.

Finisher plans include two quality sessions per week (threshold, tempo, climbing work), several endurance rides, and one long ride that builds to 4-5 hours by peak weeks.

This volume is enough to finish strong at most gravel races. You won't be competing for podiums at Tier 1 events, but you'll complete the distance at a moderate pace without heroics.

### Compete (12-18 hours/week)

You're training to race properly. Not just participate—compete.

Compete plans include three to four quality sessions per week, multiple endurance rides, and long rides that hit 5-6 hours with race-specific intensity. You're building threshold power, repeatability (surge and recover repeatedly), and the ability to hold race pace for hours.

This volume typically places riders in the top third of the field at most gravel races.

### Podium (18-25+ hours/week)

Professional-level commitment. At this volume, you need coaching, not a pre-made plan. You're managing recovery protocols, tracking performance metrics closely, and adjusting week-to-week based on how your body responds.

If you're training 20+ hours per week, get coaching. Don't self-coach unless you've already done it successfully.

---

## The Matrix: Finding Your Plan

Once you've identified both variables, you find your plan at the intersection:

### The Training Plan Matrix

The Training Recommendations skill will generate recommendations for all 4 categories and three ability levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced (including Master’s in some cases); 

\* Ayahuasca (0-5 hrs/week), 4 plans: A. Beginner \- Survival Plan (12 weeks); A. Intermediate \- Time Crunched Plan (12 weeks); A. Master’s 50+ Plan (12 weeks); A. Save My Race (6 Week Emergency Plan)

\* Finisher (8-12 hrs/week), 3 plans: Finisher Beginner \- First Timer Plan (12 Weeks), Finisher Intermediate \- Solid Finisher Plan (12 weeks); Finisher Advanced \- Strong Finish Plan

\* Compete (12-18 hrs/week), 4 plans: Compete Intermediate \- Competitive Plan (12 weeks); Compete Advanced \- Podium Contender Plan (12 weeks); Compete Master’s \- 50+ Performance Plan (12 weeks); Compete \- Save My Race (6 weeks)

\* Podium (18-25+ hrs/week)2, plans \- Podium Advanced \- Elite Preparation (12 weeks); Podium Advanced \- The G.O.A.T. Plan (12 Weeks)

How to read this matrix:

* If you're a Beginner with 8-12 hours/week → Finisher Beginner (First-Timer Plan)  
* If you're Intermediate with 12-18 hours/week → Compete Intermediate (Competitive Plan)  
* If you're Advanced with 8-12 hours/week → Finisher Advanced (Strong Finish Plan)

Some cells are empty because those combinations don't make sense:

* Beginner \+ Compete volume \= you don't have the experience to handle that training load  
* Advanced \+ Ayahuasca volume \= if you're truly advanced, you'd find more training time or you're not actually advanced anymore

### Special Category: Masters (50+)

If you're 50+ (or 40+ with significant recovery needs), there's a Masters Intermediate plan that sits between Finisher and Compete. It uses moderate volume (8-12 hours), emphasizes recovery, includes strength training 2-3x/week, and integrates HRV monitoring for autoregulation.

Masters plans assume intermediate experience but acknowledge that recovery takes longer as you age.

---

## The Bottom Line

Choosing a training plan is not complicated:

1. Assess your ability (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) based on training experience \+ current fitness  
2. Count your weekly hours (Ayahuasca / Finisher / Compete / Podium)  
3. Find the intersection on the matrix  
4. Pick that plan

# CHAPTER 4 — Training Fundamentals (Or: How Training Actually Works)

Before you start executing workouts, you need to understand how training works at a mechanical level.

Not theory for theory's sake—practical understanding that changes how you approach every session, how you structure your week, and how you respond when your body doesn't cooperate.

This chapter builds from first principles: the adaptation cycle that drives all fitness gains, the zones that define intensity, the variables you manipulate to create training stress, the phases that organize your 12 weeks, and the philosophical approaches that match different athlete types.

Start here. Everything else makes more sense after this.

---

## **The Foundational Model: How Adaptation Works**

All training follows the same basic cycle. Understanding this cycle is the difference between training intelligently and just accumulating fatigue.

### **Step 1: Stress**

You apply training stress—a hard workout that exceeds your current capacity.

This creates disruption:

* Muscle fibers develop microtears  
* Glycogen stores deplete  
* Metabolic waste accumulates  
* Cellular damage occurs

Your body registers this as a problem that needs solving.

### **Step 2: Fatigue**

Immediately after training, you're weaker than before you started.

Your muscles are damaged. Your fuel tanks are empty. Your nervous system is taxed. If you tested your FTP right after a hard interval session, it would be lower than your rested FTP.

This is normal. Fatigue is the signal that triggers adaptation.

### **Step 3: Recovery**

Given adequate rest, nutrition, and time, your body initiates repair:

* Muscle fibers rebuild  
* Mitochondria multiply (more cellular power plants)  
* Capillary density increases (better oxygen delivery)  
* Glycogen storage expands  
* Neurological efficiency improves

This takes time. The timeline depends on the magnitude of stress:

* **24-48 hours:** Muscle repair, glycogen replenishment  
* **3-7 days:** Mitochondrial adaptation, structural changes  
* **2-4 weeks:** New baseline fitness, measurable performance gains

### **Step 4: Adaptation (Supercompensation)**

If recovery is complete, your body doesn't just return to baseline—it overshoots.

This is called *supercompensation*: your body builds slightly more capacity than it had before to handle similar stress more easily next time.

You're now stronger than you were before the workout.

### **Step 5: Apply New Stress**

Once you've adapted, you apply a slightly larger stress. The cycle repeats.

Over weeks and months, these small adaptations compound into meaningful fitness gains.

---

### **Where It Goes Wrong**

**Insufficient Stress** If the workout is too easy, there's no disruption. No problem to solve. No adaptation triggered.

You're just riding around.

**Insufficient Recovery** If you apply new stress before recovery is complete, you accumulate fatigue without adaptation.

You're digging a hole, not building fitness.

**Inconsistent Stress** If you train sporadically—heroic efforts followed by weeks off—you never compound adaptations.

You're starting over every time.

---

### **The Practical Rules**

**1\. Training stress must be adequate but not excessive** Hard enough to trigger adaptation. Not so hard you can't recover.

**2\. Recovery must be prioritized as much as training** Sleep, nutrition, stress management—these aren't optional. They're where adaptation happens.

**3\. Consistency compounds** Ten weeks of steady training beats four weeks of heroics followed by injury or burnout.

**4\. Fitness is cumulative** Every completed workout adds to the total. Missed workouts don't just subtract—they prevent compounding.

**5\. Patience is required** Meaningful adaptation takes weeks and months, not days. Trust the process.

---

## **Training Zones: What They Mean and How to Use Them**

Every workout prescription includes a zone target. Here's what they mean and how to use them.

### **The Point of Zones**

Zones exist to quantify intensity and give you a common language for prescribing workouts.

But here's the paradox: the end goal of measuring intensity is to help you develop a *feeling* for intensity.

That's right—you don't use power meters, heart rate monitors, and zone charts just to become enslaved to those devices. You use them to develop an intuitive sense of effort.

Why?

Because despite our best efforts, the human body remains too complex to neatly summarize with device-generated data. Your subjective feeling is infinitely more valuable than numbered outputs based on incomplete data collection, reductive models, and population-level assumptions.

You're a special snowflake. Learn your snowflake.

### **Three Measurement Systems**

You'll see three metrics in your workouts:

**Power (% of FTP)** — The most precise. Measures actual work output in watts.

**Heart Rate (% of HRmax)** — Secondary system. Lags power by 1-3 minutes, affected by heat, hydration, fatigue, stress, caffeine. Useful for pacing long efforts.

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion, 1-10 scale)** — Your subjective experience. The ultimate arbiter. If the numbers say one thing but your body says another, trust your body.

**How to set your zones:**

* **FTP:** 20-minute all-out test, multiply average power by 0.95. Or use a ramp test.  
* **HRmax:** Maximum heart rate you've hit in the last year (excluding data spikes). Don't have that? Use 211 \- (0.64 × age). Example: age 38 \= 211 \- (0.64 × 38\) \= 186 bpm. It's an estimate, but close enough.  
* **RPE:** Practice correlating numbers with feeling. After a few weeks, you'll know what a 7/10 feels like.

### **The Zone Philosophies**

I'm not wedded to any particular zone scheme, but use these zones (Andrew Coggan for Power, Norway’s Olympia Toppen for HR, and 1-10 RPE scale) work because they're practical, proven, widely understood, correspond to actual energy systems, precise enough to describe all efforts and won't confuse you when you read other training resources.

---

### **Master Zone Chart**

| Zone | Name | % FTP | % HRmax | RPE | Feel / Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Z1** | Active Recovery | \<55% | 55-72% | 1-2 | Very easy, relaxed pace. Gentle spinning—feels like nothing. Full conversation possible. Doesn't feel like "training." Perfect for recovery spins or social rides. |
| **Z2** | Endurance | 56-75% | 72-82% | 3-4 | All-day pace—sustainable and steady. Steady aerobic work. You can chat freely. It feels easy enough to go long but purposeful. Can speak in long sentences. **This is where you should spend MOST of your training time.** |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 76-87% | 82-87% | 5-6 | Comfortably hard. Steady pace. Breathing deeper but rhythmic. Talking in short sentences or phrases. Feels sustainable for 1-2 hours. Great for tempo blocks and long sustained efforts. |
| **G Spot** | Gravel Race Pace | 88-92% | 87-92% | 6-7 | **Uncomfortably sustainable.** Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat. This is where you'll spend most of a gravel race. Breathing is controlled but deep. Can speak in short phrases but wouldn't want to. The bread and butter of gravel-specific training. |
| **Z4** | Lactate Threshold | 93-105% | 87-92% | 7-8 | Hard, controlled effort. Focused work. You can only say a few words at a time. Breathing is labored. Designed for 10-30 minute blocks. Builds your ability to produce and clear lactate. |
| **Z5** | VO2max | 106-120% | 92-100% | 9 | Very hard, heavy breathing. Near maximum. Only single words possible. Breathing is ragged; speech is nearly impossible. Efforts last 2-8 minutes. Targets max aerobic capacity. |
| **Z6** | Anaerobic Capacity | 121-150% | N/A\* | 10 | Sharp, explosive efforts—30 seconds to 3 minutes max. All-out. Legs burn, hard to breathe or talk. Builds anaerobic power and lactate tolerance. |
| **Z7** | Neuromuscular Power | \>150% | N/A\* | 10 | All-out sprints or jumps. Pure explosive power. You're not breathing hard from your lungs—your nervous system and muscles scream. Lasts only seconds. Maximum speed and skill. |

\*Heart rate can't respond fast enough to track Z6-Z7 efforts. Use power and RPE.

---

### **Why G Spot, Not Sweet Spot?**

You'll see other coaches reference "Sweet Spot" training at 88-93% FTP.

We call it G Spot instead, and it's not just branding. Here's why:

**1\. It's more intensity-specific to gravel racing**

Sweet Spot (88-93% FTP) is too high for most gravel races. Actual race data shows most gravel racers spend the majority of their time at 87-90% FTP, not 90-93%. G Spot (88-92%) better matches the reality of what you'll be doing for hours on loose surfaces.

**2\. It's better for training execution**

Sweet Spot intervals at 90-93% FTP have a nasty habit of turning into threshold intervals. You start at 90%, feel good, drift to 93%, then 95%, then you're doing threshold work when you should be doing sustainable power work. G Spot's lower ceiling (92% max) keeps you honest.

**3\. It's equally as scientific**

Frank Overton (the guy who popularized Sweet Spot) looked at a unitless graph showing two theoretical curves—one for training benefit, one for fatigue cost—pointed at their intersection, and called it science. Two can play that game. G Spot is just as made up, except it's calibrated to actual gravel race power data instead of generic training theory.

**4\. It's better named, objectively**

"Sweet Spot" sounds like something your grandmother would say about a parking space. "G Spot" is memorable, slightly provocative, and gravel-specific. Marketing matters when you're trying to remember what the hell you're supposed to be doing on Tuesday's workout.

Use G Spot. Forget Sweet Spot.

### **Critical Notes on Zone Use**

**1\. Zones are descriptive, not prescriptive**

They describe what you did, not rigid targets you must hit every second. You're targeting a range, not a precise number. If the workout says "Z2," anywhere in 56-75% FTP counts.

**2\. Easy means easy**

Most people train too hard on easy days. Zone 2 should feel conversational. If you're breathing hard, you're in Z3. Fix this.

The most common mistake in endurance training: riding "moderately hard" all the time. You need polarization—easy days truly easy (Z1-Z2), hard days truly hard (Z4-Z6). Very little time in Z3.

**3\. RPE is the ultimate arbiter**

Power meters can lie (bad calibration, stale FTP, wrong crank length). Heart rate can be misleading (heat, dehydration, caffeine, illness, fatigue).

Your body doesn't lie.

If 90% FTP feels like a 9/10 today when it should feel like 7/10, something's wrong. Either you're fatigued, sick, your FTP is stale, or conditions are harsh. Adjust accordingly.

Cross-reference all three metrics. When they align, you're dialed in. When they conflict, trust RPE.

**4\. FTP changes slowly**

Don't retest every week. Test at the start of your plan (Week 1), optionally mid-plan (Week 6-7) if you're curious, and again before your race during the taper.

Your zones don't need constant adjustment. Let the training work over weeks, not days.

**5\. Heart rate lags power**

It takes 1-3 minutes for heart rate to rise to match power output. This makes HR less useful for short intervals but reliable for longer steady efforts and endurance rides.

Use power for short, hard efforts (Z5-Z7). Use heart rate for pacing long endurance rides (Z2-Z3).

**6\. Anaerobically gifted athletes are different**

The percentages for Z5-Z7 assume average physiology. Some athletes (track sprinters, BMX racers, former football players) have exceptional anaerobic capacity. For them, 121% FTP might still feel aerobic.

If you're one of these athletes, your coach will adjust zones individually. For most gravel racers, the standard zones work fine.

---

**The Bottom Line on Zones**

Zones are tools, not masters.

Learn them. Use them. But develop your intuition so you can ride by feel when devices fail, conditions change, or your body sends signals the numbers don't capture.

Power \+ Heart Rate \+ RPE \= complete picture.

When they align, you're executing correctly.

When they conflict, trust your body.

---

## **Training Load Variables**

When you manipulate training, you're adjusting three variables: frequency, duration, and intensity.

These three create *training load*—the total stress applied to your system.

### **Frequency: How Often You Train**

**Beginner plans:** 3-4 rides per week **Intermediate plans:** 4-5 rides per week  
 **Advanced plans:** 5-6 rides per week

More isn't always better. Frequency must match recovery capacity. If you're training 6 days per week but showing up to every session fatigued, you'd be better off training 4 days and recovering properly.

**The rule:** Add frequency only after you can consistently recover from your current schedule.

### **Duration: How Long You Train**

**Ayahuasca:** 30-90 minute sessions (short, intense) **Finisher:** 60-180 minute sessions \+ one 3-5 hour long ride  
 **Compete:** 60-240 minute sessions \+ one 5-6 hour long ride  
 **Podium:** 90-360 minute sessions \+ multiple long rides

Duration creates different adaptations:

* **Short sessions (30-60 min):** Capacity focus, neuromuscular work  
* **Medium sessions (60-180 min):** Mixed work, threshold/tempo training  
* **Long sessions (3-6+ hours):** Endurance, fat oxidation, mental toughness, race specificity

**The rule:** Duration should match your time availability (Chapter 3 matrix) and race demands. Training for a 100-mile race requires different duration than training for a 50-mile race.

### **Intensity: How Hard You Train**

Measured in zones, power, heart rate, or RPE.

This is the variable most people get wrong.

**Polarized distribution** is the gold standard for most athletes:

* **80% of time:** Z1-Z2 (easy)  
* **20% of time:** Z4-Z6 (hard)  
* **Very little time:** Z3 (tempo/no man's land)

Most people train in Z3 constantly—moderately hard all the time—and wonder why they're always tired but never fast.

**The rule:** Easy days easy, hard days hard. No middle ground.

---

## **Training Load Metrics: TSS, CTL, ATL, and TSB**

Frequency, duration, and intensity determine training load, but thanks to really smart people we can go a step farther and quantify the training stress of each workout as well as in the last week and months so that we can precisely plan, monitor, and adjust training. 

### Here’s how to do that:

### **TSS (Training Stress Score)**

A single number that quantifies the total stress of a workout, accounting for both intensity and duration.

Easy 60-minute ride \= \~40 TSS  
 Hard 60-minute threshold session \= \~75 TSS  
 4-hour endurance ride with intervals \= \~250 TSS

**Why it matters:** TSS lets you compare workouts. A 90-minute tempo ride and a 60-minute VO2max session might both accumulate \~80 TSS even though they're completely different workouts. Same total stress, different stimulus.

### **CTL (Chronic Training Load) — Your Fitness**

A 42-day rolling average of your daily TSS. This is your *fitness*—the training load you've been consistently handling over the past six weeks.

CTL builds slowly. You can't gain 20 points of CTL in a week without destroying yourself.

**Why it matters:** Higher CTL \= more fitness. If your CTL is 80, you're fit enough to handle \~80 TSS per day on average. If you're consistently training below your CTL, you're maintaining or losing fitness. If you're consistently training above it, you're building fitness (or overtraining).

### **ATL (Acute Training Load) — Your Fatigue**

A 7-day rolling average of your daily TSS. This is your *fatigue*—what you've been doing recently.

ATL responds quickly. A big week spikes ATL immediately.

**Why it matters:** High ATL means you're carrying fresh fatigue. Low ATL means you're rested. During build phases, ATL should be higher than CTL (you're accumulating stress). During taper, ATL should drop below CTL (you're shedding fatigue).

### **TSB (Training Stress Balance) — Your Freshness**

**TSB \= CTL \- ATL**

This is the difference between your fitness and your fatigue. It tells you whether you're fresh or buried.

* **TSB \= \-10 to \-30:** You're tired but building fitness (normal during build phases)  
* **TSB \= \-30 to \-50:** You're very fatigued (normal during peak training weeks or after hard blocks)  
* **TSB \= 0 to \+10:** You're fresh and ready to perform (target for race day)  
* **TSB \= \+15 to \+25:** You're very fresh (ideal for major races)  
* **TSB \> \+25:** You've been resting too long, detraining may be occurring

**Why it matters:** TSB tells you if you're ready to race or if you need more recovery. During training, you *want* negative TSB (fitness is being built). On race day, you want positive TSB (fatigue is shed, fitness is expressed).

---

## **Training Phases: Base, Build, Taper**

Periodization is the organization of training into phases that build fitness systematically.

Your 12 weeks break into three phases. Each phase has distinct training characteristics and creates predictable changes in your fitness metrics (CTL), fatigue (ATL), and freshness (TSB).

---

### **Phase 1: Base (Weeks 1-4)**

**Purpose:** Establish aerobic foundation, prepare body for intensity

**Training characteristics:**

* 70-85% of volume in Z1-Z2 (easy endurance)  
* 15-30% in Z3-G Spot (tempo, sweet spot)  
* Minimal high-intensity work  
* Progressive volume increase  
* Week 4 \= recovery week (60% volume)

**What's happening physiologically:**

* Mitochondrial density increases  
* Capillary networks expand  
* Fat oxidation efficiency improves  
* Muscular endurance develops  
* Aerobic capacity builds

**Training load metrics during base:**

* **Weekly TSS:** Building from \~300-400 to \~500-700 (depending on category)  
* **CTL:** Rising steadily (+3-5 points per week)  
* **ATL:** Tracking close to CTL, moderate load  
* **TSB:** Slightly negative (-5 to \-15) most weeks  
* **Week 4 recovery:** ATL drops, TSB normalizes to near zero

**How it feels:**

Boring but doable. You should finish most rides feeling like you could do more.

**Common mistakes:**

* Going too hard on easy days (Z2 becomes Z3)  
* Skipping long rides because they're "just endurance"  
* Adding intensity because you're bored

**Why base matters:**

You can't build intensity on a weak aerobic foundation. Skipping base is like building a house on sand. It'll collapse when you add load.

The steady CTL climb during base creates the platform for everything else. If you skip base and jump straight to intensity, your CTL won't support the training stress and you'll break down.

---

### **Phase 2: Build (Weeks 5-10)**

**Purpose:** Layer intensity, develop race-specific fitness, sharpen systems

**Training characteristics:**

* 60-70% of volume in Z1-Z2  
* 30-40% in Z3-Z6 (tempo, threshold, VO2max)  
* Two to three quality sessions per week  
* Long rides now include race-specific work (surges, climbs, tempo blocks)  
* Recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks (Week 8\)

**What's happening physiologically:**

* FTP increases (threshold power improves)  
* VO2max rises (aerobic ceiling lifts)  
* Lactate clearance improves  
* Muscular power and repeatability develop  
* Race-specific adaptations occur

**Training load metrics during build:**

* **Weekly TSS:** Higher and more variable (400-800+ depending on category)  
* **Hard weeks:** 600-1000 TSS, ATL spikes, TSB goes negative (-20 to \-40)  
* **Recovery weeks:** 300-500 TSS, ATL drops, TSB recovers to \-5 to \-10  
* **CTL:** Continues rising but more gradually (+2-4 points per week)  
* **Pattern:** Yo-yo between stress accumulation and recovery

**The build phase pattern:**

This is where the magic happens. You deliberately dig a fatigue hole (TSB goes very negative during hard weeks), then recover just enough to absorb the adaptation (TSB normalizes during recovery weeks), then dig another hole.

Week 5-6: Push hard, accumulate fatigue (TSB \= \-25)  
 Week 7: Recover (TSB \= \-10)  
 Week 8: Recovery week (TSB \= \-5)  
 Week 9-10: Push harder, accumulate more fatigue (TSB \= \-35)

**How it feels:**

Hard. Quality sessions should hurt. You'll question whether you can complete intervals. That's normal.

Easy days should still be easy. If everything feels hard, you're overtraining.

**Common mistakes:**

* Turning easy days into tempo rides  
* Adding extra intervals because you feel good  
* Skipping recovery weeks because you want to keep pushing  
* Ignoring fatigue signals (TSB below \-40 for extended periods)

**Why build matters:**

This is where fitness sharpens. You're training the specific energy systems needed for gravel racing—threshold power, surge capacity, and the ability to hold race pace for hours.

Your CTL is still rising, but you're also deliberately accumulating and shedding fatigue in cycles. This stress-recovery pattern drives the deepest adaptations.

---

### **Phase 3: Peak/Taper (Weeks 11-12)**

**Purpose:** Shed accumulated fatigue, maintain sharpness, arrive fresh

**Training characteristics:**

* Volume drops 30-50%  
* Intensity stays high but duration per session decreases  
* Short, sharp efforts (maintain neuromuscular edge)  
* No new PRs, no heroics, no testing yourself  
* Prioritize sleep and recovery

**What's happening physiologically:**

* Glycogen stores top off  
* Muscular repair completes  
* Nervous system freshness returns  
* Accumulated fatigue dissipates  
* Fitness that was buried under fatigue becomes expressible

**Training load metrics during taper:**

* **Weekly TSS:** Drops significantly (200-400 TSS per week)  
* **Week 11:** \~50% of normal volume, TSB rises to \+5 to \+10  
* **Week 12:** \~40% of normal volume, TSB targets \+15 to \+25 for race day  
* **CTL:** Holds steady or drops slightly (1-3 points per week)  
* **ATL:** Drops rapidly (shedding fatigue)  
* **TSB:** Goes from negative to strongly positive

**The taper math:**

If you've completed 200+ hours of training and accumulated 80 points of CTL, your ATL might be 95 (very fatigued) going into Week 11, giving you a TSB of \-15.

Week 11: Drop volume by 50%, ATL drops to 75, TSB rises to \+5  
 Week 12: Drop volume by another 20%, ATL drops to 60, TSB rises to \+20  
 Race day: You're fresh (TSB \= \+20), fit (CTL \= 78), and ready to perform

**How it feels:**

Restless. You'll feel like you should be doing more. Your legs will feel fresh and you'll be tempted to "test" your fitness.

Ignore that feeling. Trust the taper.

**Common mistakes:**

* Panicking and adding volume because you feel undertrained  
* Testing your fitness with hard efforts (spikes ATL, ruins TSB)  
* Trying new foods, new equipment, or new anything  
* Staying up late because you're anxious

**Why taper matters:**

Fitness doesn't improve in the final two weeks—it's already built (your CTL proves it). The goal is to remove the fatigue layer (drop ATL) so you can express the fitness you've developed over the previous 10 weeks.

The positive TSB on race day is the difference between feeling buried and feeling explosive. Same fitness (CTL), different expression.

---

## **Training Philosophies: Matching Approach to Athlete Type**

A training philosophy is a systematic approach to organizing training stress. Different philosophies emphasize different variables and suit different athlete types.

All philosophies manipulate the same metrics (TSS, CTL, ATL, TSB) but do so in different patterns and with different emphasis on the training load variables (frequency, duration, intensity).

Here's how they map to the Chapter 3 matrix:

---

### **Traditional Pyramidal Periodization**

**Structure:** Big aerobic base → add tempo → add threshold → add VO2max → taper

**Volume distribution:** \~80% Z1-Z2, \~15% Z3-Z4, \~5% Z5-Z6

**Best for:**

* Finisher Beginner  
* Ayahuasca Beginner (if they have endurance background)

**Why it works:**

Conservative, progressive, teaches proper training structure. Prioritizes durability over intensity. Low injury risk.

CTL builds gradually and steadily. ATL stays moderate throughout. TSB rarely goes very negative. The conservative load management makes it ideal for athletes learning to train systematically.

**Weaknesses:**

Slow to build intensity. Not ideal for time-crunched athletes or experienced racers.

---

### **Polarized Training (80/20)**

**Structure:** 80% easy (Z1-Z2) \+ 20% hard (Z4-Z6), very little Z3

**Volume distribution:** \~80% Z1-Z2, \~5% Z3, \~15% Z4-Z6

**Best for:**

* Finisher Intermediate  
* Compete Intermediate  
* Masters Intermediate

**Why it works:**

Maximizes adaptation by keeping easy days truly easy (full recovery) and hard days truly hard (maximum stimulus). Well-researched, proven effective across endurance sports.

The polarized distribution allows consistent high weekly TSS without excessive fatigue. Hard days spike ATL significantly, but the high volume of easy days balances it out. TSB oscillates moderately week to week.

**Weaknesses:**

Requires discipline to keep easy days easy. Not ideal for time-crunched athletes who need efficiency.

---

### **HIIT-Focused / Reverse Periodization**

**Structure:** Intensity first → volume later (opposite of traditional)

**Volume distribution:** \~50% Z1-Z2, \~50% Z4-Z6 (varies by week)

**Best for:**

* Ayahuasca Intermediate  
* Ayahuasca Beginner (with caution)

**Why it works:**

Maximizes fitness gains from minimal time. Uses high-intensity intervals to build FTP quickly. Efficient for time-crunched athletes.

Weekly TSS is lower than other approaches (fewer total hours), but the high proportion of intensity creates significant training stimulus. CTL rises more slowly but efficiency is maximized per hour trained.

**Weaknesses:**

High injury risk if athlete lacks base fitness. Mentally and physically draining. Not sustainable long-term. TSB can go very negative quickly if recovery isn't prioritized.

---

### **Block Periodization**

**Structure:** Concentrated blocks of specific work separated by recovery

Example: 2-week threshold block → recovery week → 2-week VO2 block → recovery week → race-specific block

**Volume distribution:** Varies by block (concentrated stimulus)

**Best for:**

* Finisher Advanced  
* Compete Advanced

**Why it works:**

Creates deep adaptation by focusing on one system at a time. More aggressive than polarized. Allows higher intensity loads because they're concentrated and separated by recovery.

ATL spikes dramatically during blocks (TSB goes to \-30 or below), then drops during recovery weeks. The extreme oscillation between stress and recovery creates powerful adaptations but requires strong recovery capacity.

**Weaknesses:**

Requires strong base fitness and recovery capacity. Not suitable for beginners. Easy to overtrain if recovery is insufficient. TSB management is critical—miss a recovery week and you'll bury yourself.

---

### **GOAT Method (Gravel-Optimized Adaptive Training)**

**Structure:** Polarized base \+ block build \+ race-specific sharpening

Combines polarized volume with concentrated intensity blocks tailored to gravel demands (climbing, surge repeatability, sustained G Spot power).

**Best for:**

* Compete Intermediate/Advanced  
* Podium Advanced

**Why it works:**

Gravel-specific. Builds both aerobic engine (long endurance) and anaerobic capacity (surges, climbs). Balances volume and intensity for variable terrain.

Uses polarized distribution during base to build CTL efficiently, then shifts to block structure during build phase for concentrated intensity work. TSB management follows block periodization pattern but with gravel-specific intensity targets.

**Weaknesses:**

Requires experience to execute properly. Not for beginners or time-crunched athletes.

---

### **High Volume, Low Intensity (HVLI)**

**Structure:** Massive aerobic volume, minimal intensity until final weeks

**Volume distribution:** \~90% Z1-Z2, \~10% Z3-Z5 (intensity only in final 4-6 weeks)

**Best for:**

* Podium Advanced (ultra-endurance events)

**Why it works:**

Builds enormous aerobic base. Maximizes fat oxidation. Ideal for ultra-distance races where pacing is conservative.

Weekly TSS is extremely high (800-1200+) but almost entirely Z1-Z2, so ATL stays moderate relative to the volume. CTL climbs to very high levels (90-120+). TSB stays relatively stable because fatigue from easy volume is manageable.

**Weaknesses:**

Requires 18-25+ hours per week. Not practical for most athletes. Intensity arrives late, so race-specific sharpness is minimal.

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Training works through a simple cycle: stress → fatigue → recovery → adaptation.

Your job is to apply adequate stress, recover completely, and repeat consistently.

Zones quantify intensity. Frequency, duration, and intensity are the variables you manipulate to create training load. TSS, CTL, ATL, and TSB track the cumulative effect of those variables over time.

Periodization organizes your 12 weeks into coherent phases: base builds the engine (CTL rises steadily), build sharpens it (ATL/TSB oscillate with stress-recovery cycles), taper exposes it (ATL drops, TSB goes positive).

Training philosophies match different athlete types:

* Beginners need traditional pyramidal approaches  
* Intermediate athletes thrive on polarized or block periodization  
* Time-crunched athletes require HIIT-focused methods  
* Advanced athletes can handle GOAT Method or block periodization

Your plan already incorporates the right philosophy for your category and level. You don't need to choose—it's built in.

What you need to do now is execute.

The next chapter covers how to actually do the workouts.

# CHAPTER 5 — Workout Execution (Or: How to Actually Do the Damn Workouts)

You've got a plan. You understand the fundamentals. You know what the zones mean.

None of that matters if you can't execute the workouts correctly.

Most people fail training plans not because the programming is bad but because they don't know how to translate "3×15 min @ 95% FTP" into an actual ride that builds fitness instead of just accumulating fatigue.

This chapter covers execution: how to do different workout types, what to do when things go wrong, how to adjust on the fly, and the recovery protocols that make tomorrow's workout possible.

---

## **The Execution Gap**

There's a massive gap between what's written on the plan and what actually happens.

**The plan says:** "Tuesday: 3×15 min threshold @ 95-100% FTP, 8 min recovery between intervals"

**What actually happens:**

* You skip the warmup because you're running late  
* Interval 1: You go out at 105% FTP because you feel good  
* Interval 2: You're struggling to hold 95%, questioning your FTP  
* Interval 3: You bail at 10 minutes because you're cooked  
* You skip the cooldown and immediately start checking Instagram

**Result:** Incomplete workout, accumulated fatigue, no meaningful adaptation, compromised recovery for Wednesday's ride.

This chapter teaches you how to close that gap.

---

## **Universal Execution Rules**

Before we get zone-specific, here are the rules that apply to every workout:

### **1\. Warm Up Properly**

**For endurance/tempo rides:**

* 10-15 minutes Z1→Z2, progressive from very easy to comfortable

**For intensity sessions (threshold, VO2max):**

* 15-20 minutes Z1→Z2→Z3  
* Include 3×1 min at Z3-Z4 to "open the legs"  
* 2-3 minutes easy spin before first work interval

**Why it matters:** Cold muscles don't produce power efficiently. Skipping warmup compromises interval quality and increases injury risk.

### **2\. Do the Actual Workout (Not More, Not Less)**

The most common mistake: freelancing.

* "I feel great, let me do one more interval"  
* "This seems too easy, I'll bump the power up"  
* "Group ride showed up, I'll just do this instead"  
* "I'll add some sprints at the end for fun"

**The rule:** Execute what's prescribed. Not more. Not less. Trust the plan.

Adding volume or intensity might feel productive, but it accumulates fatigue, compromises recovery, and ruins tomorrow's workout.

### **3\. Chase Time-in-Zone, Not Hero Intervals**

This applies to everything from G Spot up to VO2max.

The goal is **highest average power across the entire set**, not crushing the first interval then dying.

**Bad execution:**

* Interval 1: 320W (way too hard)  
* Interval 2: 290W (struggling)  
* Interval 3: 270W (barely hanging on)  
* Interval 4: Failed  
* **Total work:** 3 intervals, 293W average, incomplete

**Good execution:**

* Interval 1: 300W (controlled)  
* Interval 2: 300W (harder but doable)  
* Interval 3: 295W (hardest one)  
* Interval 4: 295W (completed strong)  
* **Total work:** 4 intervals, 297.5W average, complete

**Which built more fitness?** The second one.

Start conservatively. Finish strong. Complete the set.

### **4\. Stop If Power Drops \>10%**

Quality beats quantity.

If you can't hold target power on interval 3+, you're done. Don't accumulate junk volume.

Four quality intervals at 300W beats six degraded intervals averaging 270W.

---

## **Zone-Specific Execution**

### **Z2 (Endurance) — The Foundation**

**Target:** 56-75% FTP, RPE 3-4, conversational

**How to execute:**

* Ride steady, no surges  
* Should feel easy enough to go for hours  
* Full sentences possible  
* Nose breathing (if you can't, you're too hard)

**Common mistakes:**

* Drifting into Z3 because you're bored  
* Turning every endurance ride into a tempo ride  
* Riding with faster friends and getting pulled up

**The fix:** Discipline. Easy means easy. This is 70-80% of your training volume. Protect it.

### **G Spot (87-92% FTP) — Gravel Race Pace**

**Target:** 88-92% FTP, RPE 6-7, "uncomfortably sustainable"

**How to execute:**

* Stay seated, control breathing  
* Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat  
* Could talk in short phrases but wouldn't want to  
* Fuel properly: 60-80g carbs/hour

**Common mistakes:**

* Pushing into threshold (93%+)  
* Not fueling adequately  
* Letting Z2 rides drift here accidentally

**The fix:** This is intentional race-pace work, not your default easy ride. Do it 2-3 times per week during build phase, not daily.

**Success looks like:** Completing all prescribed intervals, power stable within ±5%, RPE 6-7 throughout, feeling like you could do one more if forced.

### **Threshold (93-105% FTP) — FTP Development**

**Target:** 95-100% FTP, RPE 7-8, very hard but controlled

**How to execute:**

* Goal: 30-60 min total time-in-zone per session  
* Even intervals (2×20, 3×15, 4×12) beat one heroic 40-minute effort  
* Start at 95%, build into rhythm, settle at 97-98%  
* Mix terrain: flats, rollers, climbs (not only climbs)  
* Recovery: 5-10 min Z1 between intervals

**Common mistakes:**

* Treating it like an FTP test (going all-out on interval 1\)  
* Only doing threshold on climbs  
* Not completing the full set

**The fix:** Conservative start, controlled execution, complete the work.

**Success looks like:** All intervals completed at target, power consistent (±3%), RPE 7-8, interval 3 felt hardest but you finished strong.

### **VO2max (110-120% FTP) — Raising the Ceiling**

**Target:** 110-120% FTP, RPE 9, gasping, burning legs, maximal but repeatable

**How to execute:**

* Warm-up is critical: 20-25 min progressive with 3×1 min openers  
* Hit the target from the start (don't ramp up gradually)  
* Full recovery between: 4-5 min Z1, heart rate must drop below 60% max  
* Stop if power drops \>10% on any interval

**Common mistakes:**

* Hero-ing the first interval  
* Shortchanging recovery (2 min rest isn't enough)  
* Doing too many intervals (6+ is usually too much)

**The fix:** Controlled start, full recovery, stop when quality degrades.

**Success looks like:** 4-5 quality intervals at target power, RPE 9 throughout, completed the set without falling apart.

---

## **Indoor vs Outdoor Execution**

**Indoor (trainer) is better for:**

* Precision intervals (threshold, VO2max, G Spot)  
* Consistent power (no terrain variability)  
* Time-crunched sessions (no coasting, no stops)  
* Weather-proofed training

**Outdoor is better for:**

* Long endurance rides (mental sanity)  
* Race simulation (variable terrain, handling skills)  
* Group dynamics (tactical practice)  
* Staying sane

**The rule:** Use indoor for quality sessions when precision matters. Use outdoor for long rides and race-specific work.

Don't force outdoor threshold intervals on rolling terrain if you can't hold steady power. Use the trainer.

---

## **When Workouts Go Wrong**

They will. Here's how to handle it.

### **Scenario 1: You Feel Like Shit**

**Symptoms:** Sleep was bad, work was stressful, legs feel dead before you start

**What to do:**

* Reduce intensity by 5-10%  
* Shorten intervals if needed  
* Prioritize completion over heroics  
* Swap intensity for endurance if you're really cooked

**What not to do:** Push through and accumulate junk volume that compromises recovery.

### **Scenario 2: You Can't Hit Power Targets**

**Symptoms:** Interval 1 feels way harder than it should, power is 10W+ below target

**Possible causes:**

* Stale FTP (you've detrained)  
* Inadequate recovery from previous workouts  
* Illness brewing  
* Equipment issues (bad calibration)

**What to do:**

* Check equipment first  
* Drop power 5% and see if effort matches RPE  
* If still struggling, abort and take a rest day  
* Retest FTP if this happens multiple sessions in a row

### **Scenario 3: Life Happens (Missed Workouts)**

**What to do:**

* Don't double up to "make up" missed sessions  
* Don't panic and add volume  
* Execute the next workout as scheduled  
* One missed workout doesn't ruin your plan

**What not to do:** Try to cram two days into one. That just digs a deeper hole.

---

## **Autoregulation: Listening to Your Body**

Your plan is a script, not gospel. Autoregulation means adjusting based on real-time feedback.

**Check these daily:**

* Sleep quality (7-9 hours? Or 5 hours fragmented?)  
* Resting heart rate (stable? Or elevated 5+ bpm?)  
* Motivation (excited to train? Or dreading it?)  
* Physical sensations (fresh? Or sore/fatigued?)

**Decision framework:**

**Green light (execute as written):**

* Good sleep  
* Resting HR normal  
* Feeling motivated  
* Body feels fresh

**Yellow light (reduce intensity 5-10%):**

* Sleep was okay but not great  
* Slight fatigue  
* Moderate motivation

**Red light (swap intensity for easy ride or rest):**

* Multiple nights of poor sleep  
* Elevated resting HR  
* Body feels broken  
* High life stress

**The rule:** Recovery is not weakness. Training when you're buried just makes you more buried.

---

## **Post-Workout Recovery Protocols**

The workout ends when you get off the bike. Recovery starts immediately.

### **Immediately After (0-30 minutes):**

**Refuel if:**

* Session was long (\>2.5 hours) AND hard  
* More hard work coming in next 24-36 hours  
* You're in heavy training block

**Recovery nutrition:**

* 20-30g protein  
* 60-120g carbs  
* Liquid is fine (shake, chocolate milk)

**Don't need recovery nutrition if:**

* Easy endurance ride  
* Short workout (\<90 min)  
* Next workout is 48+ hours away

### **That Evening:**

**Protect your recovery:**

* Real dinner: adequate carbs \+ protein  
* Screen curfew: 60-90 min before bed  
* Same bedtime every night  
* Dark room, cool temperature, no alcohol

**Don't ruin it:**

* "I earned this" → three beers and pizza  
* Doom-scrolling until 1am  
* Late-night binge eating

**The rule:** Training gives you permission to recover well, not permission to trash recovery.

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Execution is where plans succeed or fail.

Follow the universal rules: warm up properly, do the actual workout (not more, not less), chase time-in-zone over hero intervals, stop when quality degrades.

Execute each zone correctly: Z2 stays easy, G Spot is intentional race pace, threshold is controlled hard, VO2max is gasping but repeatable.

Use indoor for precision, outdoor for sanity and race simulation.

When workouts go wrong, adjust intelligently. Autoregulate based on sleep, stress, and how your body actually feels.

Recover aggressively: refuel when needed, protect your sleep, don't ruin your work with bad evening choices.

The workouts don't execute themselves. You have to show up, do the work correctly, and recover properly.

That's the job.

Next chapter: how to fuel all of this.

# **CHAPTER 6 — Nutrition & Fueling (Or: How to Not Bonk)**

You can have perfect training, a dialed bike, and excellent pacing strategy. None of it matters if you run out of fuel halfway through your race.

Nutrition is the third most important variable after fitness and pacing. It determines 8% of your race result. That's enough to separate finishing strong from crawling to the line.

This chapter covers what to eat, when to eat it, and how to execute nutrition under race stress when your stomach is rebelling and your brain is too stupid to remember to eat.

---

## **The Nutrition Reality Check**

The cycling nutrition industry wants you to believe you need seventeen different products, each with proprietary blend ratios and specific timing windows measured in seconds.

You don't.

You need carbohydrates during exercise. You need protein and carbs after exercise. You need reasonable daily nutrition that supports training.

That's 95% of it.

Everything else is optimization you can worry about after you've nailed the basics.

---

## **Daily Nutrition for Training**

Your body is either recovering from the last workout or preparing for the next one. Daily nutrition supports both.

### **The Foundation**

**Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight**

If you weigh 70kg (154 lbs), that's 112-154g protein per day.

Why it matters: Protein rebuilds muscle tissue damaged during training. Skimp on protein and you're just breaking yourself down without rebuilding.

Sources: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, protein powder if you're lazy or vegan.

The rule: Spread it across the day. Four meals with 25-40g each beats one massive 150g post-workout shake.

**Carbohydrates: 3-7g per kg bodyweight (depends on training volume)**

Easy training days (Z2 endurance): 3-4g/kg Hard training days (intervals, long rides): 5-7g/kg Rest days: 2-3g/kg

If you weigh 70kg:

* Easy day: 210-280g carbs  
* Hard day: 350-490g carbs  
* Rest day: 140-210g carbs

Why it matters: Carbs fuel high-intensity work and restock glycogen. Train hard without adequate carbs and your intervals will suck.

Sources: Rice, potatoes, oats, bread, pasta, fruit. Real food first, gels and bars during rides only.

The rule: Match carb intake to training load. Don't carb-load on rest days. Don't under-fuel hard training blocks.

**Fat: 0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight**

If you weigh 70kg, that's 56-84g fat per day.

Why it matters: Hormones, cell membranes, vitamin absorption, satiety. Fat doesn't fuel hard efforts but it's essential for recovery and health.

Sources: Olive oil, nuts, avocados, fatty fish, whole eggs, butter.

The rule: Don't fear fat. Don't gorge on fat. Keep it moderate and consistent.

### **Timing That Actually Matters**

**Pre-workout (2-3 hours before)**

If training hard (threshold, VO2max):

* 1-2g carbs per kg bodyweight  
* Low fiber, low fat, moderate protein  
* Example: Oatmeal with banana and honey, or toast with peanut butter

If training easy (Z2 endurance):

* Eat normally, don't stress timing  
* Can even train fasted if under 90 minutes

The rule: Hard sessions need fuel. Easy sessions are flexible.

**During workout**

Covered in detail below (see "Fueling During Workouts").

Short version: 60-80g carbs per hour for rides over 90 minutes at moderate-to-high intensity.

**Post-workout (0-90 minutes after)**

If workout was long (2.5+ hours) AND hard, AND you have another hard session within 24-36 hours:

* 20-30g protein  
* 1-1.5g carbs per kg bodyweight  
* Liquid is fine (protein shake, chocolate milk)

If workout was easy, short, or your next hard session is 48+ hours away:

* Just eat your next meal normally  
* Recovery nutrition is optional

The rule: The more frequently you train hard, the more critical recovery nutrition becomes. If you're training once per day with easy sessions, skip the fancy recovery protocols and just eat dinner.

### **What About Supplements?**

Most supplements are placebo at best, actively harmful at worst.

**Worth taking:**

Vitamin D (if deficient, most people are): 2000-4000 IU daily

* Supports bone health, immune function, recovery  
* Get your levels tested, supplement accordingly

Creatine monohydrate: 5g daily

* Improves high-intensity repeatability  
* Useful for VO2max and sprint work  
* Cheap, well-researched, safe

Caffeine: 3-6mg per kg bodyweight before hard sessions

* Proven performance enhancer  
* Coffee works, pills work, gels work  
* Tolerance builds, cycle off occasionally

**Maybe worth taking:**

Beta-alanine: 3-5g daily

* Buffers lactate, helps with threshold work  
* Takes 4+ weeks to build up  
* Makes your face tingle (harmless but weird)

Beetroot juice/nitrates: 2-3 hours before hard efforts

* Improves oxygen efficiency  
* Modest gains (2-3%)  
* Tastes like dirt

**Not worth taking:**

BCAAs (branch chain amino acids): Complete waste if you eat adequate protein Testosterone boosters: Scams Fat burners: Scams with side effects Recovery drinks with proprietary blends: Overpriced protein+carbs

The rule: If you're deficient in something (Vitamin D, iron), fix it. If you're considering a supplement to "optimize," ask yourself if you've already nailed sleep, nutrition basics, and training consistency. If not, fix those first.

## **Fueling During Workouts**

This is where races are won or lost.

### **The 60-80g Carbs Per Hour Rule**

For any ride over 90 minutes at moderate-to-high intensity (Z3+), you need 60-80g of carbohydrates per hour.

Not 30g. Not 100g. 60-80g.

Why this number?

Your gut can absorb approximately 60g of glucose per hour through SGLT1 transporters. Add fructose (which uses different transporters) and you can push to 90g total. The sweet spot for most athletes is 70-75g per hour—enough to fuel hard efforts without GI distress.

**What 70g of carbs looks like:**

Option 1: 3 gels (24g each) \= 72g Option 2: 2 bottles of sports drink (35g each) \= 70g Option 3: 2 bars (40g each) \= 80g Option 4: Mix of real food \+ gels \+ drink

The rule: Pick what your stomach tolerates. Train your gut to handle race-day fueling. Don't experiment on race day.

### **Workout-Specific Fueling**

**Z2 Endurance Rides (2-4 hours)**

Intensity: Low enough to burn primarily fat Fueling: 40-60g carbs per hour

You can get away with less because you're not depleting glycogen rapidly. Real food works great here—PB\&J sandwiches, bananas, bars.

Practice eating solid food on long easy rides. This builds GI tolerance for race day.

**Tempo/G Spot Rides (2-3 hours with sustained efforts)**

Intensity: Moderate-high, significant glycogen use Fueling: 60-80g carbs per hour

Start fueling at 30-45 minutes, not 90 minutes. By the time you feel hungry, you're already behind.

Mix of liquids (faster absorption) and solids (more satisfying, prevents flavor fatigue).

**Threshold/VO2max Sessions (60-90 minutes)**

Intensity: Very high but short duration Fueling: Pre-workout meal sufficient, maybe one gel mid-session

You're not depleting glycogen in 60 minutes. Don't overthink this. Hydrate normally, maybe take a gel at 45 minutes if going long.

**Race Simulation Rides (4-6 hours with race-pace efforts)**

Intensity: Variable, high average Fueling: 70-80g carbs per hour, practice race-day nutrition

This is where you dial in your race fueling. Test different products, timing, combinations. Figure out what your stomach tolerates at race pace.

The rule: The longer and harder the ride, the more critical fueling becomes. Easy rides are forgiving. Race-pace efforts are not.

### **Hydration Protocols**

You lose 0.5-2 liters of fluid per hour depending on temperature, humidity, and effort.

Dehydration of 2-3% bodyweight impairs performance. For a 70kg rider, that's 1.4-2.1 liters—easily achievable in 2-3 hours of hard riding in heat.

**How much to drink:**

Aim for: 500-750ml per hour (16-25 oz)

More in heat, less in cold. More when sweating heavily, less when not.

The rule: Drink to thirst, but don't ignore thirst. By the time you're thirsty, you're already mildly dehydrated.

**What to drink:**

Short rides (\<90 min): Water is fine Long rides (2+ hours): Electrolyte drink with sodium

Sodium matters on long rides. You lose 500-1000mg sodium per hour through sweat. Sports drinks provide 200-400mg per bottle. Add salt tabs if racing in heat or you're a heavy/salty sweater.

Don't overthink potassium, magnesium, or trace minerals. Sodium is 90% of what matters for performance.

**Cramping**

Cramps are not caused by electrolyte deficiency (despite what the supplement industry tells you).

Cramps are caused by neuromuscular fatigue—your muscles are tired and misfiring.

Salt tabs might help by changing neuromuscular excitability, but they're not addressing the root cause. The real fix is better pacing and better training.

### **Training Your Gut**

Your gut is trainable just like your muscles.

If you never eat during training rides, your gut won't tolerate eating during races. You'll get nauseous, crampy, or shut down completely.

**How to build GI tolerance:**

Weeks 1-4 (Base Phase):

* Practice eating real food on easy rides  
* 40-50g carbs per hour, mostly solid  
* Build tolerance gradually

Weeks 5-8 (Build Phase):

* Increase to 60-70g carbs per hour  
* Mix of liquids and solids  
* Practice eating at tempo pace

Weeks 9-10 (Peak Training):

* Hit 70-80g carbs per hour  
* Race nutrition only (gels, drink, bars you'll use on race day)  
* Practice at race pace

Race Week:

* Stick with what worked in training  
* No new products  
* Trust your gut (literally)

The rule: Your gut adapts to what you consistently ask it to do. If you train it to handle 70g carbs per hour, it will. If you never practice, race day will be miserable.

---

## **Race-Day Nutrition Strategy**

Everything you practiced in training gets executed under stress.

### **Pre-Race Meal (3-4 hours before start)**

Goal: Top off glycogen, don't experiment

What to eat:

* 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight  
* Moderate protein  
* Low fat, low fiber  
* Familiar foods only

Example for 70kg rider:

* 2 cups oatmeal with banana and honey (140g carbs)  
* OR 3 pieces toast with jam and peanut butter (120g carbs)  
* OR large bowl of rice with eggs (130g carbs)

Drink 500ml water with your meal.

What not to do:

* Try the complimentary breakfast burrito with hot sauce  
* Drink coffee if you don't normally drink coffee  
* Eat significantly more or less than you practiced

### **Starting Line (30-60 minutes before start)**

Take one gel (24g carbs) with 200ml water.

This tops off your tank right before the effort begins. You're not adding meaningful glycogen at this point—you're just making sure blood glucose is stable as the race starts.

### **During the Race: The Fueling Timeline**

The most common mistake: waiting until you're hungry to start eating.

By the time you feel hungry, your glycogen is already depleted and your brain is glucose-starved. You're in a hole you can't climb out of.

**The execution framework:**

**0-30 minutes:**

* Focus on pacing, positioning, settling in  
* Sip on drink, don't force nutrition yet  
* Heart rate is spiking, gut blood flow is reduced

**30-60 minutes:**

* First gel or equivalent (24g carbs)  
* Start your fueling clock  
* Hydrate consistently

**Every 45-60 minutes after:**

* Consume 60-80g carbs per hour in consistent intervals  
* Example: Gel every 45 minutes (24g × 4 \= 96g per 3 hours, averaging 32g per hour—too low, need drink or bars too)  
* Better example: Gel every 30 minutes (24g × 2 \= 48g per hour) \+ drink with 30g per hour \= 78g total

Set a timer. Seriously. Your brain will be stupid. It will forget to eat. It will lie to you and say "I'm fine, I'll eat at the next aid station." The timer removes decision-making.

**At aid stations:**

Top off bottles. Grab food if needed. Keep moving.

Don't stop for 5 minutes eating a ham sandwich. Grab and go. You're not on a picnic.

### **When Your Stomach Rebels**

It will. At some point in a long race, your gut will protest.

**Why it happens:**

High-intensity exercise diverts blood from your GI system to working muscles. Your gut slows down. Food sits there, undigested, making you feel like shit.

**What to do:**

1. Back off intensity for 5-10 minutes  
   * Drop to Z2 pace  
   * Let gut blood flow recover  
   * Allow stomach to catch up  
2. Switch to liquid calories temporarily  
   * Easier to digest than solids  
   * Sports drink or cola at aid stations  
   * Gels if you can tolerate them  
3. Small sips, not big gulps  
   * Easier on the stomach  
   * Less sloshing  
4. Don't panic and stop eating entirely  
   * You'll bonk 30 minutes later  
   * Maintain some carb intake even if reduced

**What not to do:**

Hammer harder while nauseous. You'll either vomit or shut down completely.

The rule: Gut distress is your body telling you to back off intensity. Listen for 10 minutes, then resume pace once stomach settles.

---

## **Weight Management vs Performance**

You want to be lean for racing. Lighter climbs easier. Lower body fat improves power-to-weight ratio.

But chasing leanness during a training block is self-sabotage.

### **The Training Block Rule**

During your 12-week build, your job is to train hard and recover well. Not cut weight.

Why?

Energy deficit impairs recovery. Under-fueled training produces inferior workouts. You're trying to build fitness, not starve yourself into a smaller body.

The hierarchy:

1. Train consistently and well  
2. Recover fully  
3. Maintain current weight or gain slightly

If you finish your 12 weeks 2kg heavier but significantly fitter, you did it right.

### **When to Cut Weight**

After your race. During the off-season. When training volume is low and intensity is moderate.

A 500-calorie daily deficit over 8-12 weeks can drop 4-6kg without destroying your fitness. Do this between racing seasons, not during them.

The rule: You can be lean or you can be fast. Pick one per season. Most of the time, pick fast.

### **Body Composition Reality Check**

Optimal racing weight is highly individual. Some athletes race well at 8% body fat. Others race well at 14%.

There is no universal "race weight."

What matters: power-to-weight ratio. If your FTP is 300W at 75kg (4.0 W/kg) and you cut to 70kg but your FTP drops to 280W (also 4.0 W/kg), you gained nothing and probably lost durability.

The rule: Chase performance metrics, not scale numbers. If your FTP and climbing times improve, your weight is fine. If they're declining, eat more.

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Nutrition determines 8% of your race result. That's significant but not worth obsessing over.

Daily nutrition: Match carbs to training load. Get adequate protein. Don't fear fat. Eat real food.

Supplements: Vitamin D if deficient, creatine for high-intensity work, caffeine before hard sessions. Everything else is optional or snake oil.

During training: Practice eating 60-80g carbs per hour on long rides. Train your gut like you train your legs.

Race day: Eat a familiar pre-race meal 3-4 hours before. Start fueling at 30-45 minutes into the race. Hit 70g carbs per hour consistently. Set a timer so your stupid race brain doesn't forget.

When your stomach rebels, back off intensity for 10 minutes and switch to liquids. Don't stop eating entirely.

Weight management happens in the off-season, not during training blocks. Chase performance, not scale numbers.

Get the basics right. Execute consistently. That's 95% of nutrition.

Next chapter: Race week protocol—everything that happens in the final seven days before you pin on a number.

# **CHAPTER 7 — Race Week Protocol (Or: Don't Screw It Up Now)**

You've trained for 11 weeks. You're fit. Your CTL is peaked. Your TSB is climbing toward positive freshness.

This is not the time to experiment, panic, or make decisions based on anxiety.

Race week is about execution, not improvement. You can't get fitter in seven days. You can only show up fresh and ready, or you can sabotage yourself with bad choices.

This chapter covers what to do (and what not to do) in the final week before you pin on a number.

---

## **The Race Week Mindset**

Your fitness is locked in. It was determined by the previous 11 weeks.

Race week is administrative. You're managing logistics, protecting recovery, and arriving at the start line fresh.

The most important rule: Don't do anything stupid.

No heroic final workouts. No testing your fitness. No experimenting with equipment, nutrition, or sleep schedules.

Everything should be familiar, proven, and conservative.

---

## **Days 7-5: The Final Taper**

Your plan already dropped volume significantly in Week 11\. Now you're cutting even more.

### **Training in the Final Week**

**Monday (7 days out):**

* 60-90 minutes Z2 endurance  
* Keep legs moving, nothing hard  
* Optional: 3 × 1 min Z4 to keep neuromuscular system awake

**Tuesday (6 days out):**

* 45-60 minutes Z2  
* Maybe 2 × 3 min G Spot if you're feeling restless  
* Don't go hard

**Wednesday (5 days out):**

* Rest day or 30-45 minutes very easy spin  
* The last hard workout was 4-5 days ago  
* Everything now is just maintenance

**Thursday (4 days out):**

* 45-60 minutes Z2  
* Include 3-5 × 30 seconds Z5-Z6 (openers to keep legs sharp)  
* Last real ride before race

**Friday (3 days out):**

* Travel day (if traveling) or rest day  
* Optional 30-minute easy spin if legs feel heavy

**Saturday (2 days out):**

* 30-45 minutes Z2 with 3 × 1 min Z4 openers  
* Course preview if racing Sunday  
* No heroics

**Sunday (1 day out):**

* 20-30 minutes very easy spin or complete rest  
* Some athletes feel better with a short spin, others prefer full rest  
* Do what's worked for you previously

### **What Your Body Is Doing**

Your ATL is dropping rapidly. TSB is rising toward \+15 to \+25. You're shedding the accumulated fatigue from build weeks while maintaining the fitness.

This feels weird.

You'll have restless energy. You'll feel like you should be doing more. You'll worry you're losing fitness.

Ignore all of that. Trust the taper.

Your legs might feel heavy for the first few days. This is normal—they're glycogen-loading and repairing. By Thursday or Friday, they'll start feeling snappy again.

If your legs still feel heavy on Saturday, you either:

* Didn't taper enough (unlikely if following the plan)  
* Tapered too much (also unlikely)  
* Are getting sick (check resting HR, sleep quality)  
* Are just anxious (most common)

### **The Restlessness Problem**

You'll be tempted to "test" your fitness. Don't.

Monday you'll think: "I feel great, maybe I should do one more hard session."

No. Your last hard session was last week. Adding intensity now spikes ATL and tanks TSB. You'll arrive at the race fatigued instead of fresh.

Tuesday you'll think: "Maybe just one hard climb to see where my legs are."

No. You know where your legs are. They're exactly where 11 weeks of training put them. Testing accomplishes nothing except burning matches you'll need Sunday.

Thursday you'll think: "Should I ride longer? I feel like I'm not riding enough."

No. Volume is cut intentionally. More riding \= more fatigue \= worse race.

The rule: The taper is harder mentally than physically. Embrace boredom. Watch Netflix. Take naps. Trust the plan.

---

## **Logistics: Getting Your Shit Together**

Race week is when all the administrative details get handled.

### **Travel Planning (If Racing Away From Home)**

**Finalize by Wednesday:**

* Accommodation confirmed (hotel, Airbnb, camping)  
* Travel logistics booked (flights, car rental, gas)  
* Race check-in plan (packet pickup times, locations)

**Travel day logistics:**

* Pack bike 2 days before travel  
* Bring bike tools, spare tubes, CO2, pump  
* Confirm bike is within airline weight limits if flying  
* Add extra padding for frame, derailleurs, wheels

**Arriving 2 days early is ideal:**

* Day 1: Recover from travel, build bike, shake out ride  
* Day 2: Course preview, dial in equipment, race prep  
* Day 3: Race

Arriving day-before is workable but stressful. Arriving race morning is asking for disaster.

The rule: Eliminate logistical stress wherever possible. The race is hard enough without adding travel chaos.

### **Course Recon**

If possible, preview the course 1-2 days before the race.

What to look for:

* Major climbs (where they start, how long, how steep)  
* Technical sections (loose descents, sharp turns, sketchy surfaces)  
* Aid station locations (plan your fueling around them)  
* Final 5k (so you know where to position for finish)

You don't need to ride the entire course. Hit the critical sections—the climbs that will hurt, the descents that could cause crashes, the finish so you know when to commit.

What not to do:

* Ride the full course the day before at race pace  
* Test yourself on climbs to "see where you're at"  
* Pre-ride so long you accumulate fatigue

The rule: Course knowledge helps tactics and pacing. But don't ride so much you compromise race day legs.

### **Equipment Prep**

**Final bike check (Thursday or Friday):**

Drivetrain:

* Chain clean and lubed  
* Shifting smooth across all gears  
* No chain slip under power

Tires:

* Tubeless sealant fresh (add if needed)  
* Tire pressure set for race conditions  
* Check for cuts, sidewall damage, embedded glass

Cockpit:

* Computer charged and mounted  
* Bottles/cages secure  
* Bento box or frame bag organized

Wheels:

* Thru-axles tight  
* No spoke issues  
* Hubs spin smoothly

What not to do:

* Install new chain race week  
* Change tire pressure drastically from training  
* Add new equipment you haven't tested

**Pack race day bag (Friday or Saturday):**

Essentials:

* Spare tube (even if tubeless)  
* Tire plugs  
* CO2 cartridges (2-3) or mini pump  
* Multi-tool with chain breaker  
* Quick link for your chain  
* Tire levers

Nutrition:

* Gels, bars, chews—whatever you practiced with  
* Bottle with sports drink pre-mixed  
* Extra water bottle

Other:

* Sunscreen  
* Chamois cream  
* Arm warmers / vest (depending on weather)  
* Rain jacket (if forecast calls for it)  
* Extra base layer

Race essentials:

* Bib number and pins  
* Race chip (if using timing chip)  
* ID and emergency contact info

The rule: Pack the night before. Check it twice. Nothing new on race day.

### **Mental Preparation**

Some athletes need to visualize success and get psyched up. Others need to stay calm and avoid overactivation.

Know which one you are.

**If you tend toward anxiety:**

* Keep race week low-key  
* Avoid watching race videos or reading race reports  
* Limit caffeine  
* Focus on process (eat well, sleep well, execute plan) not outcome

**If you tend toward complacency:**

* Watch last year's race footage  
* Review your pacing strategy  
* Visualize hard moments and how you'll respond  
* Get fired up

**Universal preparation:**

Write down your race plan:

* Target pacing zones for first hour, middle section, final push  
* Fueling schedule (what to eat when)  
* Key tactical decisions (when to push, when to conserve)

Having a written plan reduces in-race decision-making when your brain is oxygen-starved and stupid.

The rule: Race week mental prep should match your personality. Anxious people need calm. Complacent people need activation.

---

## **Sleep Optimization**

Sleep is where your taper actually works. This is when TSB climbs from negative to positive.

### **The Sleep Banking Strategy**

You can't sleep 12 hours the night before and expect to feel great. Sleep works cumulatively.

**Goal: 8-9 hours per night all week**

Not just Thursday-Saturday. Every night.

Monday through Wednesday: Bank sleep while you can. Go to bed early. Sleep in if possible. Your body is repairing and restocking glycogen.

Thursday and Friday: Maintain your normal schedule. Don't stay up late packing or stressing.

Saturday night (night before race): Accept that you might not sleep great. Pre-race nerves are normal. The sleep you banked Monday-Friday matters more than Saturday night.

### **The Saturday Night Problem**

You will probably sleep poorly the night before your race.

This is fine.

Research shows that one night of poor sleep doesn't impair performance if you're well-rested going into it. The sleep debt from Monday-Friday matters. Saturday night is just one data point.

**What helps Saturday night:**

* Same bedtime as training nights (don't go to bed 2 hours early)  
* No screens 60-90 minutes before bed  
* Dark room, cool temperature  
* No alcohol (ruins sleep quality)  
* Minimal caffeine after 2pm

**What doesn't help:**

* Stressing about not sleeping (makes it worse)  
* Sleep aids you've never used before (unpredictable effects)  
* Staying up late to "tire yourself out"

The rule: Bank sleep all week. Accept that Saturday might be rough. Don't panic.

---

## **Pre-Race Meal Planning**

You should already know what works from training. Now you're just executing it under race conditions.

### **The Night Before (Dinner)**

Goal: Familiar, moderate-carb meal that won't wreck your stomach.

What to eat:

* 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight  
* Moderate protein, low fat, low fiber  
* Familiar foods (not the hotel buffet)

Examples:

* Pasta with simple tomato sauce and chicken  
* Rice bowl with salmon and vegetables  
* Baked potato with lean meat

What not to eat:

* Anything you've never eaten before  
* Heavy, greasy, or spicy foods  
* Massive portions "to carb-load"  
* Alcohol (wrecks sleep and recovery)

The rule: Dinner should be boring and familiar. This is not the time for culinary adventure.

### **Race Morning (3-4 Hours Before Start)**

Covered in Chapter 6\. Execute what you practiced.

Reminder:

* 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight  
* Low fat, low fiber, moderate protein  
* Familiar foods only  
* 500ml water with meal

Set two alarms. Eat even if you're not hungry. Your body needs fuel even if your nervous system is overriding hunger signals.

### **The Final Hour**

60 minutes before start: One gel (24g carbs) with 200ml water

30 minutes before start: Sip on sports drink, stay loose

15 minutes before start: Last bathroom stop, get to starting area

The rule: Follow your timeline. Stick to the plan. Don't freelance because you're nervous.

---

## **Race Week Nutrition**

Your training volume is way down. Your daily carb needs are also down.

**Monday-Wednesday:**

* Drop carbs slightly (you're not training hard)  
* Maintain protein (still recovering)  
* Don't drastically cut calories (you're tapering, not dieting)

**Thursday-Saturday (carb-loading window):**

* Increase carbs to 7-10g per kg bodyweight  
* You're topping off glycogen stores  
* Keep fiber low (don't want GI issues Sunday)

For a 70kg rider:

* Monday-Wednesday: 200-250g carbs per day  
* Thursday-Saturday: 500-700g carbs per day

This is strategic. You're not eating more total calories (fat drops as carbs rise). You're just shifting macros to maximize glycogen storage.

**What carb-loading looks like:**

Breakfast: Oatmeal with banana, honey, raisins (100g carbs) Snack: Rice cakes with jam (40g carbs) Lunch: Large rice bowl (120g carbs) Snack: Bagel with honey (60g carbs) Dinner: Pasta with simple sauce (150g carbs) Dessert: Sorbet or fruit (40g carbs)

Total: 510g carbs

You'll pee more. You'll gain 1-2kg water weight (glycogen binds water). This is normal and expected.

The rule: Carb-load Thursday through Saturday. Don't confuse this with eating everything in sight. You're strategically topping off glycogen, not binge eating.

## **What Not to Do Race Week**

This is where most people sabotage themselves.

**Don't:**

Get a massage Friday or Saturday

* Breaks down muscle tissue  
* Can trigger inflammatory response  
* Book it Monday or Tuesday if you must

Try new equipment

* New saddle, new tires, new anything  
* If it's not tested in training, don't race it

Test your fitness

* FTP test, hard ride, Strava segment hunting  
* All you're doing is spiking ATL and tanking TSB

Experiment with nutrition

* New gels, new bars, new supplements  
* Use what worked in training

Drink alcohol

* Ruins sleep quality  
* Impairs recovery  
* Dehydrates

Stay up late packing or stressing

* Pack Friday  
* Be in bed on time every night

Cut weight

* You're not losing fat in 7 days  
* You're just dehydrating and depleting glycogen  
* Race at the weight you trained at

**Do:**

Sleep 8-9 hours every night Follow your taper plan exactly Eat familiar foods Finalize logistics early in the week Trust your training Stay off social media if it makes you anxious Review your race plan Arrive at the start line fresh, fueled, and ready

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Race week is administrative, not developmental.

Taper exactly as prescribed. Your legs will feel weird for a few days, then they'll feel sharp. This is normal.

Handle logistics early: travel, accommodation, packet pickup, bike prep. Eliminate stress where possible.

Preview the course if you can, but don't ride so much you compromise race day.

Do your final equipment check Thursday or Friday. Pack race day bag the night before. Nothing new on race day.

Sleep 8-9 hours every night. Bank sleep Monday-Friday. Accept that Saturday night might be rough.

Carb-load Thursday through Saturday. Execute your pre-race meal plan exactly as practiced.

Don't test your fitness, don't try new things, don't panic, don't make stupid decisions.

Show up fresh. That's the entire job.

Next chapter: Race day execution—how to actually race your bike when it matters.

# **CHAPTER 9 — Post-Race & Beyond (Or: What Now?)**

You crossed the finish line. You're done.

Or are you?

What you do in the hours, days, and weeks after your race determines whether you built fitness for the long term or just peaked once and faded.

This chapter covers post-race recovery protocols, how to analyze your performance honestly, when to start training again, and how to plan your progression as a gravel racer over months and years.

---

## **Immediately Post-Race (First 30 Minutes)**

You're still breathing hard. Your legs are trashed. You want to sit down and never move again.

Don't. Not yet.

### **Keep Moving (5-10 Minutes)**

After crossing the finish line, keep pedaling easily for 5-10 minutes.

Spin in Z1, barely turning the pedals. Let your heart rate drop gradually. Flush the legs.

Why this matters: Stopping abruptly after maximal effort causes blood to pool in your legs. You'll feel dizzy, nauseous, or lightheaded. Active recovery prevents this.

Once your breathing is controlled and HR is under 100 bpm, you can stop and get off the bike.

### **Refuel Immediately (Within 30 Minutes)**

Your glycogen is depleted. Your muscles are damaged. The 30-minute post-race window is real for recovery.

**What to consume:**

* 20-30g protein  
* 60-100g carbohydrates  
* 500-750ml fluid with electrolytes

**Practical options:**

* Chocolate milk (easiest)  
* Protein shake with banana  
* Recovery drink \+ bagel  
* Whatever the finish line food tent has that's close to these macros

Don't overthink it. Get protein and carbs in quickly. Real food is fine. Liquid is fine. Just eat.

### **Rehydrate Aggressively**

You lost 1-4 liters of fluid during the race. You need to replace it.

Drink 500-1000ml within the first hour post-race. Keep drinking throughout the day.

Add electrolytes (sodium especially). Sports drink, electrolyte tabs, or just salt your food heavily.

If your pee is dark yellow by evening, you're behind on hydration. Keep drinking.

---

## **The First 24 Hours**

Your body is in recovery mode. Don't sabotage it.

### **That Afternoon/Evening**

**Eat a real meal (within 2-3 hours):**

Not just snacks. Actual food.

* Protein: 30-50g  
* Carbs: 100-150g  
* Vegetables: Yes, eat some  
* Fat: Moderate (don't go heavy)

Example: Large burrito, burger with fries, pasta with chicken, pizza with salad.

You earned this meal. Eat it.

**Light movement (optional):**

If your legs are seizing up, go for a 15-20 minute very easy walk or spin.

This is not training. This is blood flow to help recovery.

If you're too trashed to move, don't force it. Rest.

**Avoid:**

Alcohol (ruins recovery, dehydrates, impairs sleep)

* Save the celebratory beer for tomorrow

Massage (breaks down tissue that's already broken down)

* Wait 48-72 hours minimum

High-intensity anything (obvious but people are stupid)

### **Sleep**

Get 9-10 hours if possible.

This is where recovery actually happens. Don't stay up celebrating until 2am.

Go to bed early. Let your body repair.

---

## **Days 2-7: Active Recovery Week**

The week after your race is not for training. It's for recovery.

### **The Recovery Ride Protocol**

**Days 1-3 post-race:**

Rest completely or very easy 30-45 minute Z1 spins.

Your legs will be sore. Muscles are damaged. Glycogen is restocked but cellular repair is ongoing.

Don't push it. Just move blood through the legs if you feel like it.

**Days 4-7 post-race:**

Easy Z1-Z2 rides, 45-90 minutes max.

No intensity. No group rides. No Strava segments.

If you find yourself pushing hard, you're doing it wrong.

### **What Your Metrics Look Like**

**Training load:**

Your CTL (fitness) will drop slightly—that's fine. Your ATL (fatigue) drops rapidly. Your TSB (freshness) goes strongly positive (+20 to \+40).

You're shedding all the accumulated fatigue from training and racing. This is good.

**Resting heart rate:**

May be elevated 5-10 bpm for several days. This is normal—your body is in repair mode.

If it's still elevated a week later, you're not recovered. Take more rest.

**HRV (if you track it):**

Will be suppressed for 3-7 days post-race. Normal.

When it returns to baseline, you're recovered.

### **Non-Riding Recovery**

**Sleep:** 8-9 hours per night minimum

**Nutrition:** Maintain high protein (2g per kg), moderate carbs (you're not training hard)

**Hydration:** Keep drinking. Your body is still repairing.

**Stretching/Mobility:** Gentle yoga, foam rolling if it feels good

**Massage:** After day 3-4, go for it if you want

**Alcohol:** Still moderation. It still impairs recovery.

The rule: The first week post-race is not training. It's recovery. Treat it like that.

---

## **Performance Analysis: What Worked, What Didn't**

Once you've recovered enough to think clearly (day 3-5), analyze your race honestly.

### **The Data Review**

Pull up your race file (Strava, TrainingPeaks, Garmin, whatever you use).

**Look at:**

**Pacing:**

* Did you go out too hard? (HR pinned first 30-60 min)  
* Did you fade badly in the second half? (power/pace dropped \>15%)  
* Did you finish strong? (negative split or even pacing)

**Power distribution:**

* What was your normalized power as % of FTP?  
* Did it match your race plan?  
* Where did you spike unnecessarily?

**Heart rate:**

* Average HR as % of max?  
* Did you redline early and pay later?  
* Was HR appropriate for pacing?

**Fueling execution:**

* Did you hit 60-80g carbs per hour?  
* Did you bonk or have GI issues?  
* Did you drink enough? (weight loss \>3% bodyweight \= dehydrated)

**Mechanical issues:**

* Any flats, chain drops, equipment failures?  
* How long did they cost you?  
* Could you have prevented them?

### **The Honest Assessment**

Ask yourself:

**What went well?**

* Pacing discipline?  
* Fueling execution?  
* Mental toughness?  
* Equipment choices?

**What went poorly?**

* Blew up early?  
* Under-fueled?  
* Gave up mentally?  
* Mechanical issues?

**What was in your control?**

* Training preparation  
* Pacing decisions  
* Fueling execution  
* Equipment prep

**What was outside your control?**

* Weather  
* Course conditions  
* Other riders' tactics  
* Mechanicals (sometimes)

The rule: Own what you could control. Learn from what went wrong. Don't make excuses for bad decisions.

### **Setting Your Next Goal**

Based on your performance, what's the logical next step?

**If you crushed it:**

* Move up a category (Finisher → Compete)  
* Target a harder race (Tier 3 → Tier 2\)  
* Try longer distance

**If you struggled:**

* Same category, same distance, better execution  
* More training volume or better training consistency  
* Focus on the limiter (pacing, fueling, climbing, etc.)

**If you finished but didn't perform:**

* Analyze what went wrong  
* Adjust training approach  
* Maybe race was too hard for current fitness

The rule: One race is one data point. Don't overreact. But do learn.

## **When to Start Training Again**

You're recovered. You're motivated. You want to start training.

How soon is too soon?

### **The Post-Race Timeline**

**Week 1 post-race:** Complete rest or easy Z1-Z2 rides only.

**Week 2 post-race:** Resume normal Z2 endurance volume (no intensity).

**Week 3 post-race:** Add light intensity (tempo, G Spot) if feeling good.

**Week 4+ post-race:** Back to normal training (if racing again soon) or transition to off-season.

### **The Readiness Checklist**

Before resuming structured training, check:

Resting heart rate back to normal? (within 2-3 bpm of baseline) Sleep quality good? (7-9 hours, restful) Legs feel fresh? (not sore, not heavy) Motivation high? (excited to train, not forcing it) HRV recovered? (if you track it)

If all boxes are checked, you're ready.

If any are still off, take another week easy.

The rule: Don't rush back into training. The race took a toll. Recover fully before loading stress again.

---

## **Planning Your Next Season**

You're not racing next weekend. You have time to think bigger picture.

### **The Off-Season Strategy**

Most gravel racers need an off-season. Not complete rest, but reduced structure.

**What off-season looks like:**

4-8 weeks of:

* Unstructured riding (no intervals, no plan)  
* Cross-training (running, hiking, gym work)  
* Reduced volume (50-70% of peak training)  
* Focus on fun, not performance

Why this matters: Mental reset. Physical reset. Prevents burnout. Allows you to start the next training block fresh and motivated.

**When to skip off-season:**

If you're racing year-round (different seasons in different hemispheres), you might train continuously with lighter periods between races.

But most people benefit from 1-2 months per year of unstructured riding.

### **Long-Term Progression (Year Over Year)**

Gravel racing rewards consistency over time. Getting faster year-over-year requires smart progression.

**Year 1 (Your First Season):**

Focus: Build base fitness, learn to race, finish strong.

Training: Finisher or Compete volume, depending on time available.

Racing: 2-4 races, mix of distances.

Goal: Establish baseline fitness, learn what gravel racing demands.

**Year 2:**

Focus: Increase training consistency, race more strategically.

Training: Same or slightly higher volume category.

Racing: 4-6 races, target specific events.

Goal: Improve FTP, better pacing execution, place in age group.

**Year 3+:**

Focus: Specialize in distance or race type, compete for podiums.

Training: Compete or Podium volume if time allows.

Racing: 6-10 races, build season around key events.

Goal: Top 10-20% finishes, age group podiums, consider upgrading categories.

**The Long Game:**

Most gravel racers improve for 3-5 years before plateauing.

Improvements come from:

* Consistent training (no long breaks)  
* Incremental volume increases (5-10% per year)  
* Better execution (pacing, fueling, tactics)  
* Specificity (training matches race demands)

The rule: Don't try to jump from beginner to podium in one season. Build progressively over years.

---

## **The Things That Matter Long-Term**

Chasing short-term gains is easy. Building long-term performance requires discipline.

### **Consistency Over Heroics**

One massive training block followed by burnout doesn't build fitness.

52 weeks of consistent training beats 12 weeks of heroic training followed by 40 weeks off.

The rule: Show up regularly. Don't skip weeks. Don't train so hard you burn out. Boring consistency wins.

### **Recovery Over Volume**

More volume doesn't always mean more fitness.

If you're training 15 hours per week but showing up to every session fatigued, you'd be better off training 10 hours per week and recovering fully.

The rule: Volume is only useful if you can recover from it. Adapt your training to your recovery capacity.

### **Process Over Outcome**

You can't control race results. You can control:

* Training consistency  
* Nutrition quality  
* Sleep habits  
* Pacing discipline  
* Equipment prep

Focus on process. Outcomes follow.

The rule: Control what you can control. Let go of the rest.

### **Enjoyment Over Suffering**

Gravel racing should be hard but fun.

If you're miserable training, burned out racing, and dreading the next season, you're doing it wrong.

The rule: Suffering is part of racing. Misery is not. If you're not enjoying this, adjust your approach or find something else to do.

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Post-race recovery starts immediately: keep moving, refuel within 30 minutes, rehydrate aggressively.

Take a full week easy post-race. No intensity. Just recovery rides or complete rest.

Analyze your race honestly: What worked? What didn't? What do you control?

Don't rush back into training. Give your body 2-3 weeks to fully recover before loading hard training again.

Take an off-season (4-8 weeks) of unstructured riding to reset mentally and physically.

Long-term progression happens over years, not months. Build consistently, recover fully, stay patient.

Focus on process over outcome. Control what you can control.

Keep it fun. Gravel racing rewards suffering, but misery is optional.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

You finished the race. You followed the plan. You learned something about yourself and about racing bikes on dirt.

That was one race. One training block. One season.

The athletes who get fast and stay fast are the ones who show up consistently, year after year, refining their approach and building on what works.

You now have the framework: how to choose a race, how to select a training plan, how to understand training fundamentals, how to execute workouts, how to fuel, how to prepare for race week, how to race, and how to recover.

The rest is execution.

Go ride your bike. Train smart. Race hard. Recover well.

And when you're ready, do it again.

That's how you become a gravel racer.
