# The Training Plan Matrix

Once you've identified both variables, you find your plan at the intersection:

## Ayahuasca (0-5 hrs/week)

- **Beginner** → Survival Plan (12 weeks)
- **Intermediate** → Time Crunched Plan (12 weeks)
- **Master's 50+** → Master's Plan (12 weeks)
- **Emergency** → Save My Race (6 Week Emergency Plan)

## Finisher (8-12 hrs/week)

- **Beginner** → First Timer Plan (12 weeks)
- **Intermediate** → Solid Finisher Plan (12 weeks)
- **Advanced** → Strong Finish Plan (12 weeks)

## Compete (12-18 hrs/week)

- **Intermediate** → Competitive Plan (12 weeks)
- **Advanced** → Podium Contender Plan (12 weeks)
- **Master's 50+** → Performance Plan (12 weeks)
- **Emergency** → Save My Race (6 weeks)

## Podium (18-25+ hrs/week)

- **Advanced** → Elite Preparation (12 weeks)
- **Advanced** → The G.O.A.T. Plan (12 weeks)

## How to Read This

- If you're a Beginner with 8-12 hours/week → Finisher Beginner (First-Timer Plan)
- If you're Intermediate with 12-18 hours/week → Compete Intermediate (Competitive Plan)
- If you're Advanced with 8-12 hours/week → Finisher Advanced (Strong Finish Plan)

## Empty Cells

Some combinations don't make sense:

- **Beginner + Compete volume** = you don't have the experience to handle that training load
- **Advanced + Ayahuasca volume** = if you're truly advanced, you'd find more training time or you're not actually advanced anymore

## Masters (50+)

If you're 50+ (or 40+ with significant recovery needs), there's a Masters plan that sits between Finisher and Compete. It uses moderate volume (8-12 hours), emphasizes recovery, includes strength training 2-3x/week, and integrates HRV monitoring for autoregulation.

Masters plans assume intermediate experience but acknowledge that recovery takes longer as you age.
