# Weekly Volume Categories

{ATHLETE_NAME}, count the hours you'll actually spend riding each week.

Be honest. Don't count the time you *wish* you had or the time you *might* have if everything goes perfectly. Count the time you'll realistically ride, week after week, for 12 weeks straight.

Life will interfere. Work, family, weather, sickness, travel—something will try to steal your training time. Plan for 80% completion and you'll hit closer to 100%.

## The Four Categories

| Category | Weekly Hours | 12-Week Total | What This Builds |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Ayahuasca | 0-5 hours | 37-75 hours | Minimal viable fitness. Survival mode. |
| Finisher | 8-12 hours | 120-180 hours | Solid aerobic base. Finish strong. |
| Compete | 12-18 hours | 180-270 hours | Race fitness. Top-third performance. |
| Podium | 18-25+ hours | 270-375+ hours | Professional volume. Elite preparation. |

## Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're time-crunched. Maybe you've got a demanding job, young kids, or life circumstances that limit your training time to a few hours per week.

Ayahuasca plans use high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to maximize fitness from minimal time. Two to three hard sessions per week, short endurance rides, and minimal long rides (capped at 2-3 hours).

**Critical caveat:** These plans assume you already have fitness and experience. If you're a true beginner (no endurance background, currently out of shape), you should not be on an Ayahuasca plan regardless of hours available. HIIT doesn't build base fitness—it sharpens existing fitness. If you don't have a base, HIIT will just break you.

## Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This is the sweet spot for most gravel racers. You've got enough time to build a real aerobic base, practice race-specific intensity, and complete long rides that prepare you for race distance.

Finisher plans include two quality sessions per week (threshold, tempo, climbing work), several endurance rides, and one long ride that builds to 4-5 hours by peak weeks.

This volume is enough to finish strong at most gravel races.

## Compete (12-18 hours/week)

You're training to race properly. Not just participate—compete.

Compete plans include three to four quality sessions per week, multiple endurance rides, and long rides that hit 5-6 hours with race-specific intensity. You're building threshold power, repeatability (surge and recover repeatedly), and the ability to hold race pace for hours.

This volume typically places riders in the top third of the field at most gravel races.

## Podium (18-25+ hours/week)

Professional-level commitment. At this volume, you need coaching, not a pre-made plan. You're managing recovery protocols, tracking performance metrics closely, and adjusting week-to-week based on how your body responds.

If you're training 20+ hours per week, get coaching. Don't self-coach unless you've already done it successfully.
