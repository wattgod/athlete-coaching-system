# How to Choose Your Training Plan

Choosing the right training plan comes down to two variables:

1. **What is your rider ability?** (training experience + current fitness)
2. **How much time do you have per week?** (volume category)

That's it. These two variables create a matrix. Your plan lives at the intersection.

## The Common Mistake

Most people get this wrong because they conflate "how much time I have" with "how fit I am" or they pick based on ego instead of reality.

A former Cat 2 road racer who's been off the bike for three years and can only train 5 hours per week is not the same athlete as a complete beginner who's never done endurance sports and has 5 hours per week.

Same weekly hours. Completely different plans.

## The Process

1. Assess your ability (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) based on training experience + current fitness
2. Count your weekly hours (Ayahuasca / Finisher / Compete / Podium)
3. Find the intersection on the matrix
4. Pick that plan
