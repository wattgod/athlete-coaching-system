# Rider Ability Assessment

{ATHLETE_NAME}, rider ability is a combination of training experience and current fitness. Not one or the other—both.

A former pro who's been off the bike for five years and gained 40 pounds is not an advanced rider. They're intermediate at best. Their experience helps, but their current fitness is the constraint.

A recreational cyclist who's been riding consistently for three years, trains systematically, and shows up fit is not a beginner just because they've never raced. They're intermediate.

## Beginner

You're a beginner if:

- You've never trained systematically for endurance sports (cycling, running, triathlon, etc.)
- You're currently out of shape or returning after significant time off (2+ years)
- You don't know your FTP, you've never done structured intervals, and "Zone 2" sounds like a parking designation
- Long rides for you are 1-2 hours, and you're not sure you could ride 3 hours comfortably right now

This is not an insult. Everyone starts here. The mistake is pretending you're not here when you are.

**Beginner plans** build base fitness first. They assume you need to develop aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and durability before you can handle intensity. They're conservative by design because your body hasn't adapted to training stress yet.

## Intermediate

You're intermediate if:

- You've got endurance sports background—cycling, running, triathlon, or other aerobic training
- You're currently fit enough to ride 3-4 hours without falling apart
- You understand pacing, you've practiced fueling on long rides, and you know what "sustainable discomfort" feels like
- You've done structured training before or you're a strong recreational cyclist with years of consistent riding

**Intermediate plans** assume you can handle two quality sessions per week plus endurance volume. They use polarized training (80% easy, 20% hard) because your body can absorb that stress without breaking.

You're not a beginner anymore, but you're not ready for advanced periodization models that stack intensity aggressively.

## Advanced

You're advanced if:

- You're already fast. You've raced seriously (road, gravel, MTB, triathlon—doesn't matter)
- You know your FTP, you understand interval structure, and you've trained with power or heart rate zones for years
- You can distinguish between productive suffering and destructive fatigue
- Your current fitness supports 4-6 hour rides, and you've logged enough hours recently (last 6-12 months) to handle high training loads

**Advanced plans** use block periodization or the GOAT Method—concentrated periods of specific intensity (threshold blocks, VO2 blocks) followed by recovery. They assume you know your body well enough to execute hard sessions without burying yourself.

**If you're guessing whether you're advanced, you're not.** Advanced riders know.
