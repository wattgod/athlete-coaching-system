# Training Load Variables

When you manipulate training, you're adjusting three variables: frequency, duration, and intensity.

These three create *training load*—the total stress applied to your system.

## Frequency: How Often You Train

- **Beginner plans:** 3-4 rides per week
- **Intermediate plans:** 4-5 rides per week
- **Advanced plans:** 5-6 rides per week

More isn't always better. Frequency must match recovery capacity. If you're training 6 days per week but showing up to every session fatigued, you'd be better off training 4 days and recovering properly.

**The rule:** Add frequency only after you can consistently recover from your current schedule.

## Duration: How Long You Train

- **Ayahuasca:** 30-90 minute sessions (short, intense)
- **Finisher:** 60-180 minute sessions + one 3-5 hour long ride
- **Compete:** 60-240 minute sessions + one 5-6 hour long ride
- **Podium:** 90-360 minute sessions + multiple long rides

Duration creates different adaptations:
- **Short sessions (30-60 min):** Capacity focus, neuromuscular work
- **Medium sessions (60-180 min):** Mixed work, threshold/tempo training
- **Long sessions (3-6+ hours):** Endurance, fat oxidation, mental toughness, race specificity

**The rule:** Duration should match your time availability and race demands. Training for a 100-mile race requires different duration than training for a 50-mile race.

## Intensity: How Hard You Train

Measured in zones, power, heart rate, or RPE.

This is the variable most people get wrong.

**Polarized distribution** is the gold standard for most athletes:
- **80% of time:** Z1-Z2 (easy)
- **20% of time:** Z4-Z6 (hard)
- **Very little time:** Z3 (tempo/no man's land)

Most people train in Z3 constantly—moderately hard all the time—and wonder why they're always tired but never fast.

**The rule:** Easy days easy, hard days hard. No middle ground.
