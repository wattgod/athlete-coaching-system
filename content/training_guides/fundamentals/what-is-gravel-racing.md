# What Is Gravel Racing?

Gravel racing is riding bikes on unpaved roads for distances ranging from "aggressive Saturday ride" to "questioning your life choices."

The routes are typically 30-200+ miles of dirt, gravel, sand, crushed limestone, fire roads, and occasionally pavement when the route designer runs out of worse options. The surfaces vary from smooth hardpack (fast) to chunky limestone (slow and punishing) to sandy two-track (pray your tires hold air).

## What Makes Gravel Different

**It's more accessible than road racing.** No peloton politics, no sketchy criteriums where one crash takes out 40 people, no unwritten rules about who's allowed to attack when. You show up, you ride, you finish (or don't). The person who wins and the person who finishes last both rode the same course, faced the same challenges, and earned their finish.

**It's less technical than mountain biking.** You're not navigating rock gardens or launching off drops. Most gravel courses are rideable by anyone with basic bike handling skills and reasonable fitness. The bike does matter, but not as much as road racing where a 30-second gap becomes insurmountable. On gravel, you can have a mechanical, fix it, and still chase back.

**It's self-sufficient.** Aid stations exist but they're 25-40 miles apart and might run out of what you need. You carry your own food, your own tools, your own flat kit. When something breaks, you fix it. When you bonk, it's because you didn't eat enough. The race doesn't owe you anything.

**The spectrum is wide.** You can sign up for a 40-mile "fun ride" distance at most events and just enjoy being outside with a bunch of other people who also thought riding on dirt was a good idea. Or you can sign up for the 200-mile suffer fest and find out what you're made of. Both are valid. Both are gravel racing.

## The Culture

The culture rewards suffering, but it doesn't require heroics. Finishing counts. How you finish is between you and your ego.
