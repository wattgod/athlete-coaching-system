# Training Load Metrics: TSS, CTL, ATL, and TSB

Frequency, duration, and intensity determine training load, but we can quantify the training stress of each workout as well as across weeks and months so that we can precisely plan, monitor, and adjust training.

## TSS (Training Stress Score)

A single number that quantifies the total stress of a workout, accounting for both intensity and duration.

- Easy 60-minute ride = ~40 TSS
- Hard 60-minute threshold session = ~75 TSS
- 4-hour endurance ride with intervals = ~250 TSS

**Why it matters:** TSS lets you compare workouts. A 90-minute tempo ride and a 60-minute VO2max session might both accumulate ~80 TSS even though they're completely different workouts. Same total stress, different stimulus.

## CTL (Chronic Training Load) — Your Fitness

A 42-day rolling average of your daily TSS. This is your *fitness*—the training load you've been consistently handling over the past six weeks.

CTL builds slowly. You can't gain 20 points of CTL in a week without destroying yourself.

**Why it matters:** Higher CTL = more fitness. If your CTL is 80, you're fit enough to handle ~80 TSS per day on average. If you're consistently training below your CTL, you're maintaining or losing fitness. If you're consistently training above it, you're building fitness (or overtraining).

## ATL (Acute Training Load) — Your Fatigue

A 7-day rolling average of your daily TSS. This is your *fatigue*—what you've been doing recently.

ATL responds quickly. A big week spikes ATL immediately.

**Why it matters:** High ATL means you're carrying fresh fatigue. Low ATL means you're rested. During build phases, ATL should be higher than CTL (you're accumulating stress). During taper, ATL should drop below CTL (you're shedding fatigue).

## TSB (Training Stress Balance) — Your Freshness

**TSB = CTL - ATL**

This is the difference between your fitness and your fatigue. It tells you whether you're fresh or buried.

| TSB Range | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| -10 to -30 | You're tired but building fitness (normal during build phases) |
| -30 to -50 | You're very fatigued (normal during peak training weeks or after hard blocks) |
| 0 to +10 | You're fresh and ready to perform (target for race day) |
| +15 to +25 | You're very fresh (ideal for major races) |
| > +25 | You've been resting too long, detraining may be occurring |

**Why it matters:** TSB tells you if you're ready to race or if you need more recovery. During training, you *want* negative TSB (fitness is being built). On race day, you want positive TSB (fatigue is shed, fitness is expressed).
