# The Hierarchy of Speed

Here's what matters, in order:

1. **Fitness** - Costs nothing. Requires time and discipline. Determines 70% of your result.

2. **Pacing and Execution** - Free. Determines 20% of your result. You can be fit and blow up by going out too hard.

3. **Nutrition** - Cheap. Determines 8% of your result. Bonking loses races.

4. **Bike Handling** - Free (just requires practice). Determines 1.5% of your result.

5. **Equipment** - Expensive. Determines 0.5% of your result (unless your equipment is broken or wildly inappropriate).

## The Math

You can buy your way from 95% to 95.5%. You can't buy your way from 70% to 95%.

The corollary: if you're not already fast on a mediocre bike, a better bike won't make you fast. It'll make you a slower rider on a nicer bike.

## The Priority

Get fit first. Get good at suffering. Get comfortable riding on unpredictable surfaces for hours. Then worry about whether your crankset saves 40 grams.
