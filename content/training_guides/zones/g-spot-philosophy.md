# Why G-Spot, Not Sweet Spot

You'll see other coaches reference "Sweet Spot" training at 88-93% FTP.

We call it G-Spot instead, and it's not just branding. Here's why:

## 1. It's More Intensity-Specific to Gravel Racing

Sweet Spot (88-93% FTP) is too high for most gravel races. Actual race data shows most gravel racers spend the majority of their time at 87-90% FTP, not 90-93%. G-Spot (88-92%) better matches the reality of what you'll be doing for hours on loose surfaces.

## 2. It's Better for Training Execution

Sweet Spot intervals at 90-93% FTP have a nasty habit of turning into threshold intervals. You start at 90%, feel good, drift to 93%, then 95%, then you're doing threshold work when you should be doing sustainable power work. G-Spot's lower ceiling (92% max) keeps you honest.

## 3. It's Equally as Scientific

Frank Overton (the guy who popularized Sweet Spot) looked at a unitless graph showing two theoretical curves—one for training benefit, one for fatigue cost—pointed at their intersection, and called it science. Two can play that game. G-Spot is just as made up, except it's calibrated to actual gravel race power data instead of generic training theory.

## 4. It's Better Named, Objectively

"Sweet Spot" sounds like something your grandmother would say about a parking space. "G-Spot" is memorable, slightly provocative, and gravel-specific. Marketing matters when you're trying to remember what the hell you're supposed to be doing on Tuesday's workout.

## The Bottom Line

**G-Spot: 88-92% FTP**

Uncomfortably sustainable. Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat. This is where you'll spend most of a gravel race.

Breathing is controlled but deep. Can speak in short phrases but wouldn't want to. The bread and butter of gravel-specific training.

Use G-Spot. Forget Sweet Spot.
