# Master Zone Chart

| Zone | Name | % FTP | % HRmax | RPE | Feel / Description |
|------|------|-------|---------|-----|-------------------|
| **Z1** | Active Recovery | <55% | 55-72% | 1-2 | Very easy, relaxed pace. Gentle spinning—feels like nothing. Full conversation possible. Doesn't feel like "training." Perfect for recovery spins or social rides. |
| **Z2** | Endurance | 56-75% | 72-82% | 3-4 | All-day pace—sustainable and steady. Steady aerobic work. You can chat freely. It feels easy enough to go long but purposeful. Can speak in long sentences. **This is where you should spend MOST of your training time.** |
| **Z3** | Tempo | 76-87% | 82-87% | 5-6 | Comfortably hard. Steady pace. Breathing deeper but rhythmic. Talking in short sentences or phrases. Feels sustainable for 1-2 hours. Great for tempo blocks and long sustained efforts. |
| **G-Spot** | Gravel Race Pace | 88-92% | 87-92% | 6-7 | **Uncomfortably sustainable.** Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat. This is where you'll spend most of a gravel race. Breathing is controlled but deep. Can speak in short phrases but wouldn't want to. The bread and butter of gravel-specific training. |
| **Z4** | Lactate Threshold | 93-105% | 87-92% | 7-8 | Hard, controlled effort. Focused work. You can only say a few words at a time. Breathing is labored. Designed for 10-30 minute blocks. Builds your ability to produce and clear lactate. |
| **Z5** | VO2max | 106-120% | 92-100% | 9 | Very hard, heavy breathing. Near maximum. Only single words possible. Breathing is ragged; speech is nearly impossible. Efforts last 2-8 minutes. Targets max aerobic capacity. |
| **Z6** | Anaerobic Capacity | 121-150% | N/A* | 10 | Sharp, explosive efforts—30 seconds to 3 minutes max. All-out. Legs burn, hard to breathe or talk. Builds anaerobic power and lactate tolerance. |
| **Z7** | Neuromuscular Power | >150% | N/A* | 10 | All-out sprints or jumps. Pure explosive power. You're not breathing hard from your lungs—your nervous system and muscles scream. Lasts only seconds. Maximum speed and skill. |

*Heart rate can't respond fast enough to track Z6-Z7 efforts. Use power and RPE.
