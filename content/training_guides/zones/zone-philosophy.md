# Training Zones: Philosophy and Purpose

Every workout prescription includes a zone target. Here's what they mean and how to use them.

## The Point of Zones

Zones exist to quantify intensity and give you a common language for prescribing workouts.

But here's the paradox: the end goal of measuring intensity is to help you develop a *feeling* for intensity.

You don't use power meters, heart rate monitors, and zone charts just to become enslaved to those devices. You use them to develop an intuitive sense of effort.

Why?

Because despite our best efforts, the human body remains too complex to neatly summarize with device-generated data. Your subjective feeling is infinitely more valuable than numbered outputs based on incomplete data collection, reductive models, and population-level assumptions.

You're a special snowflake. Learn your snowflake.

## Three Measurement Systems

You'll see three metrics in your workouts:

**Power (% of FTP)** — The most precise. Measures actual work output in watts.

**Heart Rate (% of HRmax)** — Secondary system. Lags power by 1-3 minutes, affected by heat, hydration, fatigue, stress, caffeine. Useful for pacing long efforts.

**RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion, 1-10 scale)** — Your subjective experience. The ultimate arbiter. If the numbers say one thing but your body says another, trust your body.

## How to Set Your Zones

- **FTP:** 20-minute all-out test, multiply average power by 0.95. Or use a ramp test.
- **HRmax:** Maximum heart rate you've hit in the last year (excluding data spikes). Don't have that? Use 211 - (0.64 × age). Example: age 38 = 211 - (0.64 × 38) = 186 bpm. It's an estimate, but close enough.
- **RPE:** Practice correlating numbers with feeling. After a few weeks, you'll know what a 7/10 feels like.

## The Bottom Line

Zones are tools, not masters.

Learn them. Use them. But develop your intuition so you can ride by feel when devices fail, conditions change, or your body sends signals the numbers don't capture.

Power + Heart Rate + RPE = complete picture.

When they align, you're executing correctly. When they conflict, trust your body.
