# The G-Spot: Maximum Efficiency Zone

{ATHLETE_NAME}, if you're time-crunched but ambitious, the G-Spot is your best friend.

## Your G-Spot Range

**{SS_POWER} watts** (84-97% of your {FTP}W FTP)

## Why "G-Spot"?

It's the intersection of two curves:
- **Training stress** — High enough to drive adaptation
- **Recovery cost** — Low enough to repeat frequently

Below the G-Spot? Not enough stimulus per hour.
Above the G-Spot? Recovery debt piles up.
The G-Spot? Maximum bang for your training buck.

(Yes, we know what it sounds like. That's the point. You'll remember it.)

## Execution Cues

- **RPE** — 7/10, "comfortably uncomfortable"
- **Conversation** — Can speak in short phrases, not full sentences
- **Breathing** — Controlled but elevated
- **Duration** — Sustainable for 20-90 minutes with proper pacing

## When to Use G-Spot

- **Weekday trainer sessions** — 2x20, 3x15, or longer builds
- **Tempo portions of long rides** — Insert into Z2 rides
- **FTP building phases** — 2-3 sessions per week

## The Signature G-Spot Workout

3x15 minutes @ 88-92% FTP with 5-minute recoveries.

Simple. Repeatable. Effective.

## Warning

G-Spot is not a substitute for true Z2 or true threshold. It's a tool, not the whole toolbox. Use it when time is limited, not as your only intensity.
