# Zone 2: The Aerobic Foundation

{ATHLETE_NAME}, Zone 2 is where champions are made. Not in the glory of threshold intervals, but in the quiet accumulation of aerobic fitness.

## Your Z2 Range

**{Z2_POWER} watts** (55-75% of your {FTP}W FTP)

## Execution Cues

- **Conversational pace** — Can speak in full sentences without gasping
- **Heart rate** — 60-70% of max
- **Perceived effort** — Feels almost too easy (that's correct)
- **Breathing** — Through nose only, or close to it

## What Z2 Builds

1. **Aerobic engine capacity** — More mitochondria, more capillaries
2. **Fat oxidation efficiency** — Burn fat, spare glycogen for when you need it
3. **Durability** — The ability to hold power for hours, not minutes
4. **Recovery** — Active recovery rides live in lower Z2

## The Hard Truth

Most of your training time belongs here. Not G-Spot. Not tempo. Zone 2.

Easy isn't lazy — it's strategic. The riders who go easy enough on easy days can go hard enough on hard days. The ones who go "medium" all the time plateau fast and burn out faster.

Trust the process.
