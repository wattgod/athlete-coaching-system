# Critical Rules for Zone Execution

## 1. Zones Are Descriptive, Not Prescriptive

They describe what you did, not rigid targets you must hit every second. You're targeting a range, not a precise number. If the workout says "Z2," anywhere in 56-75% FTP counts.

## 2. Easy Means Easy

Most people train too hard on easy days. Zone 2 should feel conversational. If you're breathing hard, you're in Z3. Fix this.

The most common mistake in endurance training: riding "moderately hard" all the time. You need polarization—easy days truly easy (Z1-Z2), hard days truly hard (Z4-Z6). Very little time in Z3.

## 3. RPE Is the Ultimate Arbiter

Power meters can lie (bad calibration, stale FTP, wrong crank length). Heart rate can be misleading (heat, dehydration, caffeine, illness, fatigue).

Your body doesn't lie.

If 90% FTP feels like a 9/10 today when it should feel like 7/10, something's wrong. Either you're fatigued, sick, your FTP is stale, or conditions are harsh. Adjust accordingly.

Cross-reference all three metrics. When they align, you're dialed in. When they conflict, trust RPE.

## 4. FTP Changes Slowly

Don't retest every week. Test at the start of your plan (Week 1), optionally mid-plan (Week 6-7) if you're curious, and again before your race during the taper.

Your zones don't need constant adjustment. Let the training work over weeks, not days.

## 5. Heart Rate Lags Power

It takes 1-3 minutes for heart rate to rise to match power output. This makes HR less useful for short intervals but reliable for longer steady efforts and endurance rides.

Use power for short, hard efforts (Z5-Z7). Use heart rate for pacing long endurance rides (Z2-Z3).

## 6. Anaerobically Gifted Athletes Are Different

The percentages for Z5-Z7 assume average physiology. Some athletes (track sprinters, BMX racers, former football players) have exceptional anaerobic capacity. For them, 121% FTP might still feel aerobic.

If you're one of these athletes, your coach will adjust zones individually. For most gravel racers, the standard zones work fine.

## The Hierarchy

Power + Heart Rate + RPE = complete picture.

When they align, you're executing correctly.

When they conflict, trust your body.
