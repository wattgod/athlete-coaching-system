# The Race Tier System

Combined Course + Editorial score determines tier.

## Tier 1: 80-100 points (Iconic Races)

The marquee events. High difficulty, high prestige, national/international competition. These races define the gravel calendar. The ones people plan their season around. The ones with waitlists and lottery systems.

**Examples:** Unbound 200, Leadville 100, Belgian Waffle Ride, Mid South, SBT GRVL, Crusher in the Tushar

## Tier 2: 65-79 points (Regional Standouts)

Serious races with strong regional followings. Well-organized, challenging courses, meaningful competition at the front. Not quite iconic but respected. You'll see some fast people, solid production value, and courses that demand proper preparation.

**Examples:** Gravel Worlds, Rebecca's Private Idaho, Barry-Roubaix, Grinduro, Land Run 100

## Tier 3: 50-64 points (Solid Local Events)

Good races that are well-executed and locally popular but don't draw national fields. Still challenging, still worth training for, just without the prestige or hype. These are the backbone of the gravel calendar - consistent, reliable, fun.

**Examples:** Most state-level gravel races, smaller stage races, regional classics

## Tier 4: Under 50 points (Participation Events)

Beginner-friendly, less physically demanding, or primarily social events. Nothing wrong with these - they're entry points and fun adventures. Great for first-timers, social riders, or anyone who just wants to be outside on bikes without the pressure.

**Examples:** Local gravel grinders, charity rides, gravel "festivals" with short distances

## How to Use This

- **First-time gravel racer?** Start with Tier 3-4 events.
- **Experienced and want a challenge?** Tier 1-2.
- **Just want to ride bikes with people?** Tier 4 is perfect.

The reality check: You can show up to any race with general fitness and finish. But if you're targeting a Tier 1 event and want to perform well (not just survive), you need specific preparation that matches the race demands.
