# The Gravel God Race Ranking System

Not all gravel races are created equal. Some are iconic suffer-fests with 10,000 feet of climbing and national-level competition. Others are well-organized local events with pancake-flat routes and a beer garden at the finish.

Both are valid. But they require different preparation.

## The Problem

Most race websites oversell their difficulty and prestige. Every event claims to be "epic" and "world-class." You need an objective framework to evaluate what you're actually signing up for.

## The Solution

The Gravel God Race Ranking System scores races on two dimensions:

1. **Course Factors (0-70 points)** - Physical difficulty and demands
2. **Editorial Factors (0-30 points)** - Race quality, prestige, and experience

Total score determines tier classification.
