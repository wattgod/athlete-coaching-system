# Editorial Factors (0-30 points)

Race quality, prestige, and experience factors that don't directly affect physical training but matter for race selection.

| Factor | Max Points | What It Measures |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Prestige | 10 | Does winning/finishing this race mean something? Unbound, DK, Belgian Waffle Ride = high prestige. Random county gravel grinder = low. |
| Community | 5 | Is the gravel community present? Do people travel for this? Is there camaraderie or just registration numbers? |
| Production Quality | 5 | Is the event well-organized? Clear marking, adequate aid, good communication, professional execution. |
| Vibe/Atmosphere | 5 | Is this a party with a bike race attached (Mid South) or a serious competition (Unbound)? Both are fine, know what you're getting. |
| Inclusivity | 3 | Multiple distance options, beginner-friendly, welcoming culture vs. gatekeeping "hardcore" posturing. |
| Value | 2 | Registration cost vs. what you get. $200 for a well-supported event = reasonable. $200 for marked routes and nothing else = questionable. |
