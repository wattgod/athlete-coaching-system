# Course Factors (0-70 points)

Physical demands that affect training requirements and race difficulty.

| Factor | Max Points | What It Measures |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Distance | 15 | Longer = harder. 200 miles ≠ 50 miles × 4. Fatigue accumulates exponentially. |
| Elevation Gain | 15 | Climbing is the great equalizer. 15,000 ft of climbing matters regardless of distance. |
| Terrain Difficulty | 10 | Smooth hardpack (easy) vs. chunky limestone (hard) vs. sand/mud (survival mode). |
| Weather Exposure | 10 | Kansas August heat, Iceland wind, Arizona desert sun - environmental stress compounds physical stress. |
| Altitude | 10 | Racing above 7,000 ft adds significant physiological challenge. Leadville at 10,000+ ft is a different game. |
| Technical Demand | 5 | Steep loose descents, sustained technical sections, mandatory bike handling skills. |
| Logistical Difficulty | 5 | Remote locations, limited aid, self-supported sections, navigation requirements. |

## How to Score

Be honest. A flat 50-miler on smooth roads is not the same as a 50-miler with 8,000 feet of climbing on chunky gravel. The score should reflect what your body will experience.
