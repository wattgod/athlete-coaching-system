# Block Periodization

**Structure:** Concentrated blocks of specific work separated by recovery

Example: 2-week threshold block → recovery week → 2-week VO2 block → recovery week → race-specific block

**Volume distribution:** Varies by block (concentrated stimulus)

## Best For

- Finisher Advanced
- Compete Advanced

## Why It Works

Creates deep adaptation by focusing on one system at a time. More aggressive than polarized. Allows higher intensity loads because they're concentrated and separated by recovery.

ATL spikes dramatically during blocks (TSB goes to -30 or below), then drops during recovery weeks. The extreme oscillation between stress and recovery creates powerful adaptations but requires strong recovery capacity.

## Weaknesses

Requires strong base fitness and recovery capacity. Not suitable for beginners. Easy to overtrain if recovery is insufficient. TSB management is critical—miss a recovery week and you'll bury yourself.

## Example Block Sequence

- Weeks 1-2: Threshold block (concentrated Z4 work)
- Week 3: Recovery
- Weeks 4-5: VO2max block (concentrated Z5 work)
- Week 6: Recovery
- Weeks 7-8: Race-specific block
