# HIIT-Focused / Reverse Periodization

**Structure:** Intensity first → volume later (opposite of traditional)

**Volume distribution:** ~50% Z1-Z2, ~50% Z4-Z6 (varies by week)

## Best For

- Ayahuasca Intermediate
- Ayahuasca Beginner (with caution)

## Why It Works

Maximizes fitness gains from minimal time. Uses high-intensity intervals to build FTP quickly. Efficient for time-crunched athletes.

Weekly TSS is lower than other approaches (fewer total hours), but the high proportion of intensity creates significant training stimulus. CTL rises more slowly but efficiency is maximized per hour trained.

## Weaknesses

High injury risk if athlete lacks base fitness. Mentally and physically draining. Not sustainable long-term. TSB can go very negative quickly if recovery isn't prioritized.

## Critical Warning

These plans assume you already have fitness and experience. If you're a true beginner (no endurance background, currently out of shape), you should NOT use HIIT-focused training. HIIT doesn't build base fitness—it sharpens existing fitness. If you don't have a base, HIIT will just break you.
