# Polarized Training (80/20)

**Structure:** 80% easy (Z1-Z2) + 20% hard (Z4-Z6), very little Z3

**Volume distribution:** ~80% Z1-Z2, ~5% Z3, ~15% Z4-Z6

## Best For

- Finisher Intermediate
- Compete Intermediate
- Masters Intermediate

## Why It Works

Maximizes adaptation by keeping easy days truly easy (full recovery) and hard days truly hard (maximum stimulus). Well-researched, proven effective across endurance sports.

The polarized distribution allows consistent high weekly TSS without excessive fatigue. Hard days spike ATL significantly, but the high volume of easy days balances it out. TSB oscillates moderately week to week.

## Weaknesses

Requires discipline to keep easy days easy. Not ideal for time-crunched athletes who need efficiency.

## Key Principle

Easy means easy. Hard means hard. No middle ground.

Most people train in Z3 constantly—moderately hard all the time—and wonder why they're always tired but never fast.
