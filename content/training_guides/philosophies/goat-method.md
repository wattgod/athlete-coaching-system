# GOAT Method (Gravel-Optimized Adaptive Training)

**Structure:** Polarized base + block build + race-specific sharpening

Combines polarized volume with concentrated intensity blocks tailored to gravel demands (climbing, surge repeatability, sustained G-Spot power).

## Best For

- Compete Intermediate/Advanced
- Podium Advanced

## Why It Works

Gravel-specific. Builds both aerobic engine (long endurance) and anaerobic capacity (surges, climbs). Balances volume and intensity for variable terrain.

Uses polarized distribution during base to build CTL efficiently, then shifts to block structure during build phase for concentrated intensity work. TSB management follows block periodization pattern but with gravel-specific intensity targets.

## Gravel-Specific Elements

- **Climbing blocks:** Sustained efforts on grades matching target race
- **Surge repeatability:** Repeated accelerations simulating race dynamics
- **G-Spot endurance:** Extended time at 88-92% FTP on varied terrain

## Weaknesses

Requires experience to execute properly. Not for beginners or time-crunched athletes.

## The Phases

1. **Base (Weeks 1-4):** Polarized, build CTL
2. **Build (Weeks 5-10):** Block structure, gravel-specific intensity
3. **Peak (Weeks 11-12):** Taper with race-specific sharpening
