# The Execution Gap

There's a massive gap between what's written on the plan and what actually happens.

## The Plan Says

"Tuesday: 3×15 min threshold @ 95-100% FTP, 8 min recovery between intervals"

## What Actually Happens

- You skip the warmup because you're running late
- Interval 1: You go out at 105% FTP because you feel good
- Interval 2: You're struggling to hold 95%, questioning your FTP
- Interval 3: You bail at 10 minutes because you're cooked
- You skip the cooldown and immediately start checking Instagram

## The Result

Incomplete workout, accumulated fatigue, no meaningful adaptation, compromised recovery for Wednesday's ride.

## Why This Matters

Most people fail training plans not because the programming is bad but because they don't know how to translate "3×15 min @ 95% FTP" into an actual ride that builds fitness instead of just accumulating fatigue.

## The Fix

Execution is a skill. It requires:

1. **Proper warmup** — 15-20 minutes minimum before intensity
2. **Pacing discipline** — Start conservative, finish strong
3. **Recovery respect** — Full rest between intervals
4. **Cooldown completion** — 10+ minutes easy spinning
5. **Session integrity** — Complete the prescription as written

Your job is to close the gap between what's written and what actually happens.
