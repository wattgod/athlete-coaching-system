# Phase 3: Peak/Taper (Weeks 11-12)

{ATHLETE_NAME}, the taper phase sheds accumulated fatigue while maintaining sharpness so you arrive fresh on race day.

## Training Characteristics

- Volume drops 30-50%
- Intensity stays high but duration per session decreases
- Short, sharp efforts (maintain neuromuscular edge)
- No new PRs, no heroics, no testing yourself
- Prioritize sleep and recovery

## What's Happening Physiologically

- Glycogen stores top off
- Muscular repair completes
- Nervous system freshness returns
- Accumulated fatigue dissipates
- Fitness that was buried under fatigue becomes expressible

## Training Load Metrics During Taper

- **Weekly TSS:** Drops significantly (200-400 TSS per week)
- **Week 11:** ~50% of normal volume, TSB rises to +5 to +10
- **Week 12:** ~40% of normal volume, TSB targets +15 to +25 for race day
- **CTL:** Holds steady or drops slightly (1-3 points per week)
- **ATL:** Drops rapidly (shedding fatigue)
- **TSB:** Goes from negative to strongly positive

## The Taper Math

If you've completed 200+ hours of training and accumulated 80 points of CTL, your ATL might be 95 (very fatigued) going into Week 11, giving you a TSB of -15.

- Week 11: Drop volume by 50%, ATL drops to 75, TSB rises to +5
- Week 12: Drop volume by another 20%, ATL drops to 60, TSB rises to +20
- Race day: You're fresh (TSB = +20), fit (CTL = 78), and ready to perform

## How It Feels

Restless. You'll feel like you should be doing more. Your legs will feel fresh and you'll be tempted to "test" your fitness.

Ignore that feeling. Trust the taper.

## Common Mistakes

- Panicking and adding volume because you feel undertrained
- Testing your fitness with hard efforts (spikes ATL, ruins TSB)
- Trying new foods, new equipment, or new anything
- Staying up late because you're anxious

## Why Taper Matters

Fitness doesn't improve in the final two weeks—it's already built (your CTL proves it). The goal is to remove the fatigue layer (drop ATL) so you can express the fitness you've developed over the previous 10 weeks.

The positive TSB on race day is the difference between feeling buried and feeling explosive. Same fitness (CTL), different expression.
