# Phase 1: Base (Weeks 1-4)

{ATHLETE_NAME}, the base phase establishes your aerobic foundation and prepares your body for intensity.

## Training Characteristics

- 70-85% of volume in Z1-Z2 (easy endurance)
- 15-30% in Z3-G Spot (tempo, G-Spot)
- Minimal high-intensity work
- Progressive volume increase
- Week 4 = recovery week (60% volume)

## What's Happening Physiologically

- Mitochondrial density increases
- Capillary networks expand
- Fat oxidation efficiency improves
- Muscular endurance develops
- Aerobic capacity builds

## Training Load Metrics During Base

- **Weekly TSS:** Building from ~300-400 to ~500-700 (depending on category)
- **CTL:** Rising steadily (+3-5 points per week)
- **ATL:** Tracking close to CTL, moderate load
- **TSB:** Slightly negative (-5 to -15) most weeks
- **Week 4 recovery:** ATL drops, TSB normalizes to near zero

## How It Feels

Boring but doable. You should finish most rides feeling like you could do more.

## Common Mistakes

- Going too hard on easy days (Z2 becomes Z3)
- Skipping long rides because they're "just endurance"
- Adding intensity because you're bored

## Why Base Matters

You can't build intensity on a weak aerobic foundation. Skipping base is like building a house on sand. It'll collapse when you add load.

The steady CTL climb during base creates the platform for everything else. If you skip base and jump straight to intensity, your CTL won't support the training stress and you'll break down.
