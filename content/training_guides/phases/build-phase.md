# Phase 2: Build (Weeks 5-10)

{ATHLETE_NAME}, the build phase layers intensity and develops race-specific fitness.

## Training Characteristics

- 60-70% of volume in Z1-Z2
- 30-40% in Z3-Z6 (tempo, threshold, VO2max)
- Two to three quality sessions per week
- Long rides now include race-specific work (surges, climbs, tempo blocks)
- Recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks (Week 8)

## What's Happening Physiologically

- FTP increases (threshold power improves)
- VO2max rises (aerobic ceiling lifts)
- Lactate clearance improves
- Muscular power and repeatability develop
- Race-specific adaptations occur

## Training Load Metrics During Build

- **Weekly TSS:** Higher and more variable (400-800+ depending on category)
- **Hard weeks:** 600-1000 TSS, ATL spikes, TSB goes negative (-20 to -40)
- **Recovery weeks:** 300-500 TSS, ATL drops, TSB recovers to -5 to -10
- **CTL:** Continues rising but more gradually (+2-4 points per week)
- **Pattern:** Yo-yo between stress accumulation and recovery

## The Build Phase Pattern

This is where the magic happens. You deliberately dig a fatigue hole (TSB goes very negative during hard weeks), then recover just enough to absorb the adaptation (TSB normalizes during recovery weeks), then dig another hole.

- Week 5-6: Push hard, accumulate fatigue (TSB = -25)
- Week 7: Recover (TSB = -10)
- Week 8: Recovery week (TSB = -5)
- Week 9-10: Push harder, accumulate more fatigue (TSB = -35)

## How It Feels

Hard. Quality sessions should hurt. You'll question whether you can complete intervals. That's normal.

Easy days should still be easy. If everything feels hard, you're overtraining.

## Common Mistakes

- Turning easy days into tempo rides
- Adding extra intervals because you feel good
- Skipping recovery weeks because you want to keep pushing
- Ignoring fatigue signals (TSB below -40 for extended periods)

## Why Build Matters

This is where fitness sharpens. You're training the specific energy systems needed for gravel racing—threshold power, surge capacity, and the ability to hold race pace for hours.

Your CTL is still rising, but you're also deliberately accumulating and shedding fatigue in cycles. This stress-recovery pattern drives the deepest adaptations.
