# Welcome to Gravel God Coaching

{ATHLETE_NAME},

Welcome to the crew. You've made a commitment to yourself, and I'm here to help you see it through.

## What You're Getting Into

This isn't a "just follow the plan" coaching relationship. We're partners in this. I bring the programming, the analysis, and the course correction. You bring the execution, the honesty, and the communication.

**Your primary goal:** {GOAL_EVENT} on {EVENT_DATE}

Everything we do from now until then points toward that day. Every workout, every recovery day, every decision about sleep and nutrition — it all serves the goal.

## My Philosophy in 30 Seconds

1. **Recovery makes you fast** — Training is stress; adaptation happens at rest
2. **Consistency beats heroics** — 10 good weeks beats 3 perfect weeks and 7 missed weeks
3. **Data informs, doesn't dictate** — Power meters are guides, not gods
4. **Specificity matters** — Train for what you're training for
5. **Honest communication** — Tell me when life happens. I can't help if I don't know

## What I Need From You

- **Execute the workouts** — Not perfectly, but consistently
- **Communicate proactively** — Travel, stress, illness, good rides, bad rides
- **Trust the easy days** — They're in the plan for a reason
- **Ask questions** — There are no dumb questions about your training

## What You Can Expect From Me

- Weekly review of your training data
- Quick responses to questions (within 24 hours)
- Honest feedback, even when it's not what you want to hear
- Adjustments when life throws curveballs

Let's get to work.
