# Why Recovery Makes You Fast

{ATHLETE_NAME}, let's get something straight from day one: **recovery isn't the absence of training — it's where adaptation happens.**

When you're pushing watts on the bike, you're not getting faster. You're creating stress. The magic happens when you stop — when your body rebuilds, adapts, and comes back stronger than before.

## The Three Pillars of Recovery

1. **Sleep** — 7-9 hours, non-negotiable. This is when growth hormone peaks and muscle repair accelerates. Cutting sleep to train more is like filling your tank while the gas is leaking out.

2. **Nutrition** — Protein within 30 minutes post-ride. Carbs to refill glycogen. Real food beats supplements every time.

3. **Stress Management** — Training stress + life stress = total stress. Your body doesn't distinguish between a hard interval session and a hard day at work. Both count.

## The Bottom Line

You don't get a medal for being tired. Rest isn't lazy — it's strategic.

The athletes who win aren't always the ones who train hardest. They're the ones who recover hardest.
