# Matti Rowe - Training Owner's Manual
**Generated from 10 years of data (2015-2024) | 6,000+ hours | 1,700+ activities**

## The Executive Summary

You are a high-volume amateur cyclist who has accumulated more training hours than 99% of age-groupers. After analyzing a decade of your data with statistical rigor, here's what actually matters:

**Show up 6+ times per week. Keep most rides moderate. Stop chasing hours.**

That's it. Everything below is the evidence.

## Part 1: Who You Are (Physiologically)

### Your Power Profile
| Duration | Mean | Max | What It Means |
|----------|------|-----|---------------|
| 5 sec | 411W | 834W | Good sprint, not a pure sprinter |
| 1 min | 360W | 544W | Solid anaerobic capacity |
| 5 min | 326W | 475W | Strong VO2max power |
| 20 min | 294W | 407W | ~350W FTP typical |
| 60 min | 265W | 322W | Good sustained power |
| 90 min | 260W | 303W | Where you shine |

### Your Recovery Signature
**Intensity Factor (IF) dominates how you feel the next day.**

| Factor | Impact on Next-Day Feeling |
|--------|---------------------------|
| IF | **96.6%** of the variance |
| CTL | 1.7% |
| TSB | 1.3% |

Translation: A hard ride (high IF) crushes your next day. Accumulated fitness (CTL) and freshness (TSB) barely matter compared to yesterday's intensity.

**Implication:** You're intensity-sensitive. One hard day costs more than you'd expect. Plan recovery accordingly.

### Your Responder Type
The Banister model was inconclusive for VO2max/threshold trainability. What we can say:

- **Endurance (90min+):** You're a **slow responder**. CTL negatively correlates with sustained power (r=-0.28). You need freshness to perform long efforts.
- **Peak Powers (3-20min):** No clear CTL signal. Dominated by seasonal variation and noise.

**Implication:** For target events, taper aggressively. Your endurance power comes from freshness, not fitness accumulation.

## Part 2: What Actually Predicts Your Performance

### The Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

| Predictor | Correlation | Confidence | Effect Size |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Rides per week** | r = 0.60 (yearly) | High | +85W from 4→6 rides/wk |
| **Easy volume (prior 3mo)** | r = 0.46 | High | Foundation builder |
| **Hard ride count** | r = 0.41 (raw) | Medium | +72W from 0→4 hard rides |
| Season (month) | r = 0.87 | High | 68W swing (confound) |
| Hours/year | r = -0.27 | High | **Negative!** |
| TSS | r = -0.11 | High | Not predictive |
| CTL | ~0 | High | Failed all tests |

### What This Means

1. **Frequency is king.** Going from 4 to 6 rides per week predicts better peaks than any other variable.

2. **Easy volume builds the foundation.** Your prior 3-month easy kJ correlates with this month's peak power. Work capacity theory is real for you.

3. **Hard rides help, but only to a point.** The dose-response curve:
   - 0→1 hard ride: +33W
   - 1→2: +12W
   - 2→3: +13W
   - 3→4: +13W
   - 4→5: **+0W** (plateau)

4. **More hours doesn't mean better performance.** Your highest volume years (2022-2023: 763-809 hours) produced your lowest peaks (394-409W). Your best year (2020: 586W) was 730 hours - high but not highest.

5. **CTL is not your friend.** After controlling for season, reverse causation, and other confounds, CTL explains essentially nothing about your peak power.

## Part 3: The Story of Your Training (2015-2024)

### The Build Years (2015-2018)
- **Volume:** 511-614 hours/year
- **Intensity:** High (avg IF 0.74-0.80)
- **Peaks:** Consistent 500-507W
- **Pattern:** Building fitness, moderate volume, plenty of hard days (34% of rides IF>0.85 in 2017)

### The Breakthrough Year (2020)
- **Volume:** 730 hours
- **Frequency:** **6.2 rides/week** (career high)
- **Intensity:** Moderate (avg IF 0.72, only 1% hard days)
- **Peak:** **586W** (career best)
- **What was different:**
  - 38 weeks with 6+ rides (vs 18-21 other years)
  - 18 weeks with 7 rides (vs 2-7 other years)
  - Hardly any truly hard days (23 all year vs 144 in 2017)
  - 62% of rides in moderate zone (0.7-0.85 IF)

### The Volume Trap (2022-2023)
- **Volume:** 763-809 hours (career high)
- **Frequency:** 5.0-5.3 rides/week (down from 2020)
- **Intensity:** Lower (avg IF 0.69-0.70)
- **Peaks:** **394-409W** (career low for full training years)
- **What went wrong:**
  - More hours, fewer rides per week
  - Longer rides, less frequency
  - 51% easy rides (vs 38% in 2020)
  - Lost the moderate-intensity sweet spot

### The Lesson
Your best year wasn't your highest volume year. It was your most **consistent** year. Six rides per week, most of them moderate, almost no grinding. Then you tried to add more hours and performance dropped.

## Part 4: Your Optimal Training Formula

### The 2020 Blueprint (What Worked)

| Metric | Target | Your 2020 |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Rides/week | 6+ | 6.2 |
| Hours/year | 650-750 | 730 |
| % Easy (IF<0.7) | 35-40% | 38% |
| % Moderate (IF 0.7-0.85) | 55-65% | 62% |
| % Hard (IF>0.85) | <5% | 1% |
| Hard ride count | 3-4/week | ~3 |

### The Weekly Template

**Monday:** Easy/Off
**Tuesday:** Moderate (tempo/SS, IF 0.75-0.85)
**Wednesday:** Moderate (endurance+, IF 0.70-0.80)
**Thursday:** Hard (intervals, IF 0.85-0.95) - only hard day of the week
**Friday:** Easy (recovery, IF <0.65)
**Saturday:** Moderate-Long (IF 0.70-0.80)
**Sunday:** Moderate (group ride pace, IF 0.75-0.85)

**Total: 6-7 rides, 1 hard day, 5-6 moderate/easy days**

### The Intensity Distribution

```
Easy (Z1-Z2):     35-40%  ████████
Moderate (Z3-Z4): 55-65%  █████████████
Hard (Z5+):       <5%     █
```

This is NOT polarized training (80/20). This is **moderate-dominant** training. Your data says it works better for you.

### What to Avoid

1. **Chasing hours.** You've done 800+ hour years. They were your worst.

2. **Too many hard days.** 2017 had 34% hard days and produced 501W. 2020 had 1% hard days and produced 586W.

3. **Skipping days to do longer rides.** Five 2-hour rides beats three 3.5-hour rides for you.

4. **CTL targets.** Stop looking at the number. It doesn't predict your performance.

## Part 5: Pre-Event Protocol

### Your Endurance Signature
You're a slow responder for sustained efforts. High CTL = lower 90min+ power.

### Taper Recommendations
For A-priority events:

| Days Out | Training |
|----------|----------|
| 14-10 | Maintain frequency, reduce duration 20% |
| 10-7 | Reduce volume 40%, keep 2 moderate rides |
| 7-3 | Easy only, 4-5 short rides |
| 3-1 | Openers only (short efforts to stay sharp) |
| Race day | Fresh legs > fitness |

**Key insight:** You perform 90min+ efforts better when fresh, not when fit. Err on the side of more rest.

## Part 6: Seasonal Considerations

### Your Monthly Power Pattern
| Month | Avg Peak 5min | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Jan | 373W | Winter base |
| Feb | 380W | Building |
| Mar | 386W | Early season |
| Apr | 392W | Coming into form |
| **May** | **405W** | Peak season starts |
| Jun | 391W | Good |
| **Jul** | **406W** | Peak |
| Aug | 403W | Holding |
| Sep | 368W | Decline starts |
| Oct | 358W | Off-season |
| **Nov** | **338W** | Lowest |
| Dec | 367W | Base building |

**68W swing from peak (July) to trough (November)**

### Planning Implications
- Target A-events for May-August
- Accept lower power in fall/winter
- Don't fight the seasonal pattern - work with it

## Part 7: What We Don't Know

### Limitations of This Analysis

1. **n=1.** This is your data. Specific numbers may not transfer to others.

2. **Observational, not experimental.** We found correlations, not proven causation.

3. **67% unexplained variance.** Most of your day-to-day performance is noise (weather, sleep, stress, motivation).

4. **No polarized comparison.** You train moderate-dominant. We can't say polarized would be worse or better.

5. **Age is a confound.** You're older now than in 2020. Some decline is expected.

### Questions We Can't Answer

- Would true polarized training work better?
- What's your ceiling with optimal training?
- How much is genetics vs training?
- Would structured intervals beat your moderate approach?

## Part 8: The Actionable Checklist

### Weekly Non-Negotiables
- [ ] 6+ rides this week
- [ ] No more than 1 hard day (IF > 0.85)
- [ ] At least 4 moderate rides (IF 0.70-0.85)
- [ ] Don't skip days to do longer rides

### Monthly Check-In
- [ ] Averaging 6+ rides/week?
- [ ] Intensity distribution: 35-40% easy, 55-65% moderate, <5% hard?
- [ ] Any warning signs of overreaching? (declining peaks, poor recovery)

### Yearly Planning
- [ ] Target 650-750 hours (not 800+)
- [ ] Plan A-events for May-August
- [ ] Aggressive taper (2+ weeks) for key events
- [ ] Track rides/week, not just hours

## The Final Word

You've done the work. 6,000+ hours. A decade of data. What does it say?

**Stop trying to out-volume yourself. Start showing up more often.**

Your best year came from consistency, not intensity. From moderate effort, not grinding. From 6 rides a week, not 800 hours a year.

The fitness industry wants to sell you complexity. Your data says the answer is simple:

**Ride your bike. Do it often. Don't be a hero. Trust the process.**
