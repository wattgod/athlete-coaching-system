"Lactate Ramp Test","Bike","Pre-Test Preparation: Consistency Across Tests: Ensure everything is consistent for effective comparison across tests. Morning of the Test: Nutrition: Have a significant impact on results. Avoid high carbohydrate meals/drinks close to the test to prevent elevated blood glucose and disproportionate energy oxidation from carbohydrates. Recommend fasting for ~3hrs before the test. Warm-Up: Lactate Measurement: Obtain a resting baseline measure of lactate before starting the warm-up. Duration: Around 30-60 minutes, depending on various factors. Can be done prior to official test time in a commercial lab setting. Intensity: Very easy, ideally below 50% of anticipated threshold. The Test: Format: Step test with 5-minute stages, allowing physiological processes to stabilize before increasing to the next level. Continuation: Go to volitional fatigue, regardless of the number of stages completed. Sampling Procedure: Set-Up: Table: Ensure you have a table set at a working height, which is crucial when self-testing on a bike. Hygiene and Organization: Hand Cleaning: Thoroughly clean your hands before starting the test to maintain hygiene. Strip Preparation: Have all the required strips lined up and ready to use, aiming to minimize the time between samplings. Sampling Procedure: Follow this sequence meticulously to ensure accurate and hygienic sampling: Alcohol Swab: Use it to clean the finger that will be lanced. Lancing: Use a sterile lancet to prick the cleaned finger to draw a drop of blood. First Wipe: Use a gauze pad to wipe away the first drop of blood, along with any residual alcohol. Second Wipe (if necessary): If you are particularly sweaty, you may need to wipe away a second drop to ensure a clean sample. Test Strip: Gently place the test strip into the blood drop, ensuring not to touch the skin. The strip is designed to use capillary action to draw up the blood. By following these steps, you can ensure a clean and precise blood sample for your test. Practical Notes: Initial Fitness Estimate: Doesn’t need to be completely accurate; could be from the last test or a recent race. Preparation: Have all materials ready and know the sampling sequence. Erg Mode for Bike Test: Makes it easier for the athlete, allowing focus on the test rather than holding a given power.","1","","2023-11-15","","8100","265","401","647.438","","0.678284704685211","3.31699991226196","","73","","138","175","","","0.822995237393878","45.39","19","9","4","5","5","","","","","","9","11","10","10","1","0","","","","","",""

"Fixing Anterior Pelvic Tilt","Strength","Fixing Anterior Pelvic Tilt Below I have listed five exercises that will help correct an anterior pelvic tilt and help relieve the feeling of tight hamstrings. The focus of the first two exercises is increasing length through the anterior musculature of the hip. The focus of the second two is strengthening the posterior chain and the final exercise to strengthen the anterior core. In general All of these exercises will help, but in you spend most of your day sitting at a desk these exercises in and of themselves will not reverse the damage from hour upon hour of sitting when your hip flexors shortened and your glutes asleep. Minimally, need to do two things, which are annoying: Get a standing desk - you should stand at least ⅓ of the day. This will be annoying at first, but it’s essential that you spend some time standing with good posture for parts of the day. Getting a bosu ball for sitting - A bosu ball requires more balance and extra recruitment for your core. Optional - get a ‘good posture’ halter. I know this seems corney, but it will for you to stop hunching over which promotes better posture. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Front Foot Elevated Split Squat The split squat is a great exercise to open up the anterior hip and also has the added benefit of also improving ankle mobility. Increasing length through your hip flexors will help decrease some of the tension placed on the hamstrings. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dYFpa-ZT2s&feature=youtu.be 2. Couch Stretch The added benefit of the couch stretch compared to a regular hip flexor stretch is it stretches the rectus femoris, a muscle which is often forgotten. The rectus femoris is a biarticular muscle, meaning it crosses two joints, thus to stretch it, the knee needs to be in flexion while the hips are in extension. The standard, half kneeling hip flexor stretch only targets illiopsoas and not the rectus femoris. When fixing an anterior tilt, it is important to assess both these areas. Squeeze your glute on the same side. This will posteriorly tilt the pelvis and ensure you get a greater stretch in the rectus femoris. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKl5UoiG5c 3. Romanian Deadlift The Romanian Deadlift is a great exercise to strengthen the glutes, hamstrings and lower back. Although you will use a lighter load when compared to a regular deadlift, the Romanian Deadlift is arguably greater hamstring stimulus due to it being pure hip extension with minimal movement from the knee. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1LrH79jxQQ 4. Glute Ham Raise The glute ham raise strengthens the hamstrings at both the hip and the knee joint simultaneously. It works both primary functions, knee flexion and hip extension while also being a closed kinetic chain exercise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT6I4K8xiFU&feature=youtu.be 5. Deadbug The deadbug is a great anterior core drill which teaches people to dissociate movement from the lumbar spine and the hips. The goal of this exercise is to maintain neutral spine and not go into over extension as you lower your leg. The cue to focus on is to keep your ribs down and lower back flat against the floor the whole time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaCc3AbXLwo&feature=youtu.be 5.

So visualize that in the feeling - that they shouldn't be max sprints, basically just jumps until the final one and then go full. Mix them seated and standing just how you probably would in a race.

So I think long term I see more to gain by doing it here where you're a bit less comfortable and working to get on it. Maybe can just at least throw it in some, so it's not all done on LH. Also, my thought with this route was to do a box of all right hand turns which should let you be a bit more on it. In the past I've always done the box of: start heading N on 75th - R on Woodland - R on 95th - R on 66 (R on 75th to repeat). You have that long pretty fast section on Woodland, but it's a section that in a race you'd lose time by not being on the power so it's good practice.* *05/04/2020 Matti Rowe: Cool man I'll try that box.*","2.17016530036926","10.9090003967285","","82","","135","162","","","0.775852186549202","129.94","37","59","21","23","4","0","0","","","","21","53","11","21","25","2","0","","","","",""

Need more stack under stem.  Back was tweaking on 5/6th reps. 2. No way in hell I'm riding to the base. 3. I need to start really early (like 4 am) for two reasons: The first is to avoid more of the heat.  The second is avoiding more traffic (it's pretty bad). 4. I rolled on a 30t today, I'm going to want that 32t for sure. 5. I brought 5 water bottles with me and by 5th lap I was out - I just can't get so far behind on hydration - I'll just fall apart. 6. Descent time without traffic is comfortably sub 10.  With traffic and a small stop to refresh a bottle it's more like 13minutes. 7. I think sub 35 laps are doable, but it's going to depend entirely on fueling.* *06/29/2020 Nate Wilson: Looks like the numbers line up pretty well - since you were mostly doing 285-290w and 33' laps. So I think you can take 275w and not be over 35'. I still think that is the # to start at and you pick it up as you go on if you feel good. Really good notes though. Especially to put more stack under the stem. The only thing I'm wondering is if with a 32t your back wouldn't bother you as much? But I think in general adding some stack would be AOK. Yeah for sure I think you need to drink a bottle / lap. I would just make the routine that you grab a bottle out of the cooler @ the top of the climb and you have to drink it by the top. I think if you stick on that schedule you'll pee a lot but you'll be pretty hydrated. If the bottle is 25-35g of carbs you don't need to eat anything that lap, if it isn't that rich you need to eat something that is ~30g of carbs. Basically you want to take 30-40g of carbs / lap. And yeah - to ride there on the day of seems like asking for trouble!

That's the second bad intensity workout I've had this week. I think I'm a little buried from loads of diesel work. My observation is that it is easy to get carried away with diesel work because you can be boxed and still ride forever or do loads of tempo without noticing that holding Z7 for 90 seconds or pushing into threshold puts you on the floor. I'm going to get really into napping.* *08/16/2020 Nate Wilson: Definitely and this is a lot of my issue with chasing CTL or doing too much sustained load. Sure you can keep racking up days with time @ 300w but ultimately there's a lot more fatigue in the background than it seems like until we try some top end. It'll be good to actually step away from the diesel stuff for a bit and get into some snappier stuff. But with that also make the recovery days recovery - and don't get sucked into just turning every easy day into 90' @ 250w or such.

So don't beat yourself up too much if you don't throttle it on the trainer.

So think about anything in your position right now that doesn't feel sustainable - stuff like if you're using the arms to holds yourself up a lot so you can't stay committed to the sticks, can't keep head down, etc.","1.5","","2020-10-26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It's a great way to get in some intensity here and there - but it should be an additive to the work we need to get done, not a subtraction.

If on trainer - mixed tempo work as follows: Warm up 5min ~300w (4min recovery) 5min build 260w < 360w (4min recovery) 10min ~300w (8min recovery) 10min alt 4min 300w / 1min 360w (8min recovery) 5min build 260w < 360w (4min recovery) 5min ~300w Cool down","1","","2018-12-27","","71214.6328125","281","497","2032.765","","2.00503754615784","9.86600017547607","","0","","137","172","","","0.816811551298149","133.21","43","58","20","13","2","0","0","","","","4","66","14","17","19","4","0","","","","",""

Your HR was a bit higher for similar power, but that's no surprise given we probably tapered in, and it was probably warmer, and you were touching the top end with a bit more frequency. The kind of adrenal boost you get on race day, makes that effort so much easier. So to knock it out in training, a bit more power, less HR drift, lower HR - great sign for January!

Flag looks mostly good, just looks like HR got quite high in the second half. Second set of 30/30's was down a bit, so yeah maybe just missing some pop. In a race scenario a thing to help here as well is a caffeine gel, like 100 mg, ~45-60 min before the final is going to start taking off. You can try this out in training on these kinds of rides and see how it feels.* *02/05/2019 Matti Rowe: Ooooo great idea!  I do respond well to those caffeine/carb gels.

These numbers seem low and you can see in the file there are an unrealistic number of drops. Will increase this one to 320 TSS.

I made a call to push hard so we stayed away but knew that would fuck me for the finish. I managed to beat one of the guys to the line, but Dewar and Selker were too punchy. In hindsight maybe I should have tried to jump them in the rotation earlier when they seemed worked?* *04/15/2019 Nate Wilson: Yeah that's a tough one - always that gamble between you want the break to stay away and you'd take 3 or 4 over getting caught by the field. But then figuring out from there how you can increase your odds of winning if you know you're likely not to just taking the group to the line. If they're truly dead weight it's good sometimes to try and dump them early, as long as you're not worried that they have a strong team back in the field that might then rip the chase. If they're not total dead weight, but they're just on the limit a bit - then yeah best thing is find a moment when you're at the back, and they're on the front - sometimes you need to find a way to sit out a turn, or sort of change your position within the group through a corner - to target the guy you want to get rid of. Wait until they pull and they're almost just about pulling off and then just whack it as hard as you can around them - swing to the other side of the road from the back so that they can't just be straight on the wheel.*","2.80418300628662","11.25","","93","","146","179","","","0.834058289050565","194.21","39","43","33","33","32","2","0","","","","69","29","10","12","16","18","15","","","","",""

One noticeable thing was that power was down. Wasn't a total killer since weight was lower this year than last, but it's dawning on me for the future that once you're approaching the final runway to a stage race it's stupid to play those deficits so hard. Power tends to go away and you don't have that reserve to tap into when you're 5 days in.  I think I've gotten away with it a few times this year on one-day races but if I roll into a JMSR or a Gila I started super hungry I'm going to pay a price. Obvious shit, I'm sure, but I'm putting this down here as much for myself for the future.* *05/09/2019 Nate Wilson: Hey I think that's really good feedback. I also went and looked back at all your weight logs for the past 8 weeks or so and you were pretty much 75-76 kg running into JMSR and at JMSR. Then after JMSR you started dropping a bit more to 74 kg; may be that just put a bit more strain on the whole build leading up to Gila and on Gila itself - especially like you're saying if in the days leading in you were clutching super hard to keep the weight there. Once you get within 3 days of the race it's definitely important to be conscious of having the glycogen stores topped up.*","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I think I could have bled more on this one.* *05/20/2019 Nate Wilson: Power wise this is awesome progress as well. 372w for 17 min. Back earlier in the year when we were doing TT efforts on our 63/Nelson/75 TT box you did one in Dec that was ~20 min @ 335w and then another in Feb that was 347w. So similar duration and another 25w - that's fitness baby! Looking at HR I don't think you should read into it. If you look at that graph it looks like it was just wrong. Like either battery dying or maybe picking up sometime and then just dropping and not reading right others. Any time the graph really shows that weird boxy line for HR I don't place too much value on it. Also sorry I didn't have this in the schedule. I guess I didn't really realize that when you weren't going to Seattle that meant you were probably gonna do the TT. Probably would've changed the lead in a bit, but looks like this worked fine. Send me some photos of you in the TT if you find some.* *05/20/2019 Nate Wilson: I also think you did a better job of applying power across the course this year and didn't drop so much on the downhills. On the downhills being a bit heavier helps, but i also think we need to get you more aero before you're really getting advantage of your weight - looking forward to playing with this perhaps a bit more this summer.*","1.59170913696289","8.40499973297119","","84","","130","172","","","0.769132713511899","93.31","52","32","5","8","8","0","0","","","","31","37","6","4","6","12","0","","","","",""

Had a teammate in the break with me and he attacked on the 4th lap and stuck it for the W.  I'd like to say I could have followed, not that I should have, but I didn't have the punch he had. Paced it in with another guy and kept the field at bay for 5th.  A little pissed I didn't snag 4th because he was gassed and I felt good, but he had a wicked punch to him and even though I tried to surprise him a few times, I couldn't shake him and he just blew past me on the last part of the wall. I know it's not really in my wheelhouse, but damn a bit more punch could go a long way.* *05/20/2019 Nate Wilson: Man, this is really awesome. I remember a few years ago we were just trying to figure out how to get you stay in the field in this race. Now you're in the break and top 5! I also think this version of the course is harder, there's just no recovery. Yeah the punch up the wall for the finish is always tough for guys like you and me. I remember being in that spot a few times on this race and feeling like I could roll another lap fairly hard but I just could never do the 700w 30 sec or whatever it would be for me. That said, it's something to never give up on - and you will keep getting better at it. Where did you try and ditch him? I always think over the top of climbs is one of the best place, because everyone is just suffering on the climb but mentally prepared to do so and they're telling themselves just make it to the downhill and it'll get easy, and if you can just whack it super hard over the top and even come from a couple lengths back so you come back with some momentum sometimes you can just beat them mentally and they can't even try to get on the wheel.

Yeah that's an interesting one - I guess by time ~50-55% of the course would be better on a TT bike. So it's a tough call. In the WT they'd probably do a bike change for this. I guess it just comes down to being comfortable climbing on the TT bike. Next year this would be a fun one to do some specific efforts to prepare for like just doing some hard climbing on TT bike and seeing how it feels. If I just saw your power for the shelf climb I'd think it wasn't bad - 360w for 10 min at that elevation is pretty solid for you.

Follow each squat set with a 60 sec recovery, and then 5x squat jumps or box jumps. Recover for 3 min between sets.

Follow each squat set with a 60 sec recovery, and then 5x squat jumps or box jumps. Recover for 3 min between sets.

Standing felt bad - could generate more power seated.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯* *12/18/2017 Nate Wilson: Yeah, torque for sure is an element, sometimes you just don't have the gradient (or gear, whatever way you want to look at it) to do the cadence you're most comfortable making power at - so if you can do 380w for 20min @ 95 rpm, but all of a sudden at 85 rpm you can't handle the torque for that duration it changes. The other factor is a bit more anecdotal and I don't have a good grasp on the biomechanics, but if you think about it from a gravity perspective - force of gravity is always straight down, as gradient changes though, the ""effective vector"" changes and can shift a bit how you're applying force to the pedals against gravity - so I think the sensation can just be quite different. Plenty of people can only do power on flats, or only on climbs - important just to mix it up so that you are versatile.* *12/18/2017 Nate Wilson: Looks like weight is coming along, good work Matti!* *12/18/2017 Nate Wilson: Good power on that final climb, looks like you're ready to start adding layers to this once you're back from Wisco.

This is an easy stage to make a hole in the beginning, and if you make that hole then end up in the break right when the pace comes off, then you never get out of the hole.","4","","2018-04-19","","123420","","","","","3.88277777777778","8.82958935470024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TT","Bike","Don't need to go nuts on the warmup as you're pretty open after the first two days, but it may take awhile to get open. Ideal is to ride to the TT course (light 20-30min), then do just enough effort once there to open up. 1x3-5min low race pace, and 2-3 x short accelerations. Once you feel the legs pop open that's enough.","2","","2018-04-20","Sensation will likely be a more powerful guide than power today: First climb = hard but controlled, in the bars as much as possible Up to speed ASAP into the downhill, and then goal is ""aero"" not power production Rollers both directions, driving hard over the top up to speed, then floating slightly into the next. Last big climb out = taste blood, taste blood over the top and up to 35mph. Get small, any time you feel the speed drop, you give it 20 sec HARD to get it back up. Grade drops out the last 1-2k and you've got to just big dog it and get ugly, STAY SMALL!!","59328.01171875","220","728","1495.284"," *04/23/2018 Nate Wilson: First off hat's off Matti - that's a legit ride! Congratulations. 342w for 37min on the TT bike is best power we've seen over that duration on the TT bike for sure - not a ton of apples to apples comparisons, but yes solid. Even by the components of the TT most were probably near PR's on their own: First climb - 14m, 378w Rollers - 9m, 353w - you did well to oscillate a bit but not soft cock the downhills too much here. Final climb - 5m, 390w Yeah good stuff man! Can see the CTL was up - but I'd like to think you had this ride in you regardless of the load, you've done better preparation on the TT bike this year than you have.

I was on it but then a guy in front of me flatted, it killed my speed and the last 20 guys in the peloton blew by me.  I couldn't catch back on. For a final fuck you, the guy who flatted came blowing by me while hanging onto a car. Instead of burying myself so I could start the climb 3 minutes behind the lead group and fight for 30th place I just rode back. - Takeaways?: 1. It's cool I've lost some weight but I'm still too fat. 2. I don't know how to move in a pack well.  Good legs and good weight are great, but if you're in the back it doesn't matter because all your matches are going to be spent just getting back on terms with the front group when moves go. Any tips? Do more crits? 3. TT is back to disappointing.  Gila TT went well because it's less about CdA.  My CdA will never be elite but c'mon, there MUST be some way I can get it down in the .24-.25 range.  Any recommendations?* *07/02/2018 Nate Wilson: I don't know if I'd say you're too fat. There may be more weight to lose, but there's also a breaking point where you may be light for you, but that's also still just not killer w/kg light. And it may not be that you're too fat but it's just your a big guy and that's that. I think doing more crits is a good idea. Sounds like you lost a lot of energy in the two main RRs because of pack skills. Like this today with getting behind the guy with the flat is something I don't think of as something that should happen - you just have to force your way around, so some of it is aggression - using your size as an advantage.

Baseline @ 346w, you did 2.32k in 3:38 Narrow @ 349w, you did 2.32k in 3:29 So both wattages the position change from baseline to narrow (what we settled on) saved ~10 sec over 2.3 km. You can see the speed differential was not massive between 300w and 350w (~3-4 kph), we'd expect that as speed differential goes up for the wattage gap (i.e. on a flatter terrain, i.e. 45+ kph) we'd see a bigger time differential (not necessarily on distance, but as a % of time) - so for a 3.5min chunk @ 40 kph maybe we're seeing ~10s, but at 50 kph it might be as much as 12-15s per 3.5 min. So yeah, I think that's pretty good savings. There's enough grey area that we can't say with full confidence ok it'll save X per 40km or something - I'm sure we'll see some variability. But I think we can say that this position is faster, within the range of significance, beyond the error of devices and human measurement. I used the 2.3k segment because it removes your start/stop that you did yourself, so hopefully removes some of that error.

I also took a leftover hashbrown on the ride, which was a mistake, because it tanked my stomach, preventing me from really taking down more than 2 gels and a mojo until the last hour when I ate a snickers.

I can feel myself moving around a little on the seat, which is normal, but I also thing my knee might be actually hitting my chest even though the seat height on the fit hasn't changed.

The other factor is a bit more anecdotal and I don't have a good grasp on the biomechanics, but if you think about it from a gravity perspective - force of gravity is always straight down, as gradient changes though, the ""effective vector"" changes and can shift a bit how you're applying force to the pedals against gravity - so I think the sensation can just be quite different. Plenty of people can only do power on flats, or only on climbs - important just to mix it up so that you are versatile.* *12/18/2017 Nate Wilson: Looks like weight is coming along, good work Matti!* *12/18/2017 Nate Wilson: Good power on that final climb, looks like you're ready to start adding layers to this once you're back from Wisco.

I did finish though, which I've never been close to fit enough to do. I also beat a lot of guys that by default think they're better than me.  So fuck those guys.

This is a race where I think performance really is the best reflection of progress. This is one of those races where peak power #s are never really PRs because it's just hard all day, and so usually when folks have a bad day they look at the #s and feel even worse about it. So without being too patronizing I think realizing it's the first time you've finished and you were actually in the front end of the race for a bit is awesome progress. This race is also great prep for Salida. I feel like that climb at Salida is honestly a bit shorter and punchier and you can get over it. But yeah it will come down to a lot of reps. Thanks for thanking me but I think you owe it to yourself - you're the one busting your tail. You've done awesome work to slim down this year and that's been a really noticeable performance bump.

I was on it but then a guy in front of me flatted, it killed my speed and the last 20 guys in the peloton blew by me.  I couldn't catch back on. For a final fuck you, the guy who flatted came blowing by me while hanging onto a car. Instead of burying myself so I could start the climb 3 minutes behind the lead group and fight for 30th place I just rode back. - Takeaways?: 1. It's cool I've lost some weight but I'm still too fat. 2. I don't know how to move in a pack well.  Good legs and good weight are great, but if you're in the back it doesn't matter because all your matches are going to be spent just getting back on terms with the front group when moves go. Any tips? Do more crits? 3. TT is back to disappointing.  Gila TT went well because it's less about CdA.  My CdA will never be elite but c'mon, there MUST be some way I can get it down in the .24-.25 range.  Any recommendations?* *07/02/2018 Nate Wilson: I don't know if I'd say you're too fat. There may be more weight to lose, but there's also a breaking point where you may be light for you, but that's also still just not killer w/kg light. And it may not be that you're too fat but it's just your a big guy and that's that. I think doing more crits is a good idea. Sounds like you lost a lot of energy in the two main RRs because of pack skills. Like this today with getting behind the guy with the flat is something I don't think of as something that should happen - you just have to force your way around, so some of it is aggression - using your size as an advantage. Let's look at some photos of the position, and maybe pull some of the slick tricks GC used and see if we can get you a bit slipperier.*","4.00560188293457","10.1040000915527","","98","","","","","","0.709170221544118","200.82","","","","","","","","","","","94","68","22","21","17","15","7","","","","",""

Baseline @ 346w, you did 2.32k in 3:38 Narrow @ 349w, you did 2.32k in 3:29 So both wattages the position change from baseline to narrow (what we settled on) saved ~10 sec over 2.3 km. You can see the speed differential was not massive between 300w and 350w (~3-4 kph), we'd expect that as speed differential goes up for the wattage gap (i.e. on a flatter terrain, i.e. 45+ kph) we'd see a bigger time differential (not necessarily on distance, but as a % of time) - so for a 3.5min chunk @ 40 kph maybe we're seeing ~10s, but at 50 kph it might be as much as 12-15s per 3.5 min. So yeah, I think that's pretty good savings. There's enough grey area that we can't say with full confidence ok it'll save X per 40km or something - I'm sure we'll see some variability. But I think we can say that this position is faster, within the range of significance, beyond the error of devices and human measurement. I used the 2.3k segment because it removes your start/stop that you did yourself, so hopefully removes some of that error. From today the closest thing we can say is that at a 40 kph avg TT, in a 20min TT this could be as much as 40-50 sec.

I wasn't destroyed after the last interval (though I was starting to feel it a bit) - go figure. Saddle is up ~2cm. The one thing I really noticed is that I can produce more power in the saddle on climbs. It's almost like I'm getting a split second extra of recovery every pedal stroke, but am putting down the same power, so net I feel less buried.  I kinda thought it was all in my head, bc my SF time was 27:11, which is good (for me) but off my best, but interestingly the second half from the Amphitheater to the top was my 2nd best all time, only off 11 seconds from my PR, and I was carrying a flat kit and bottles which I never do if I'm going for a PR.  Huh!* *08/20/2018 Nate Wilson: That's a big differential in saddle - but sounds like it's super positive. Great to be that close to PR on the top part of Flag!

Stayed away from the LT bc I didn't want to go to the well and be in the box for 3 days. I struggled on the nutrition side today - I didn't start until almost noon, so by the time I started I had about 1300kcal in the fire which took me an hour to work through on the ride, so I didn't start eating until 90m in.  I also took a leftover hashbrown on the ride, which was a mistake, because it tanked my stomach, preventing me from really taking down more than 2 gels and a mojo until the last hour when I ate a snickers.  This is all to say I did not hit the 70g/hr mark, but intensity was in check so I never felt bad either. Just thought you should know.
